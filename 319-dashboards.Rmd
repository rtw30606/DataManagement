### Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

Students completing this chapter will:

-   Understand the purpose of dashboards;

-   Be able to use the R package shinydashboard to create a dashboard.

## The value of dashboards {.unnumbered}

A dashboard is a web page or mobile app screen designed to present
important information, primarily visual format, that can be quickly and
easily comprehended. Dashboards are often used to show the current
status, such as the weather app you have on your smart phone. Sometimes,
a dashboard can also show historical data as a means of trying to
identify long term trends. Key economic indicators for the last decade
or so might be shown graphically to help strategic planners identify
major shifts in economic activity. In a world overflowing with data,
dashboards are an information system for summarizing and presenting key
data. They can be very useful for maintaining situation awareness, by
providing information about key environmental measures of the current
situation and possible future developments.

A dashboard typically has a header, sidebar and body

### Header {.unnumbered}

There is a header across the top of a page indicating the purpose of the
dashboard, and additional facts about the content, such as the creator.
A search engine is a common element of a header. A header can also
contain tabs to various sources of information or reports (e.g., social
media or Fortune 1000 companies).

### Sidebar {.unnumbered}

A sidebar usually contains features that enable the body of the report
to be customized to the viewer's needs. There might be filters to
fine-tune what is displayed. Alternatively, there can be links to select
information on a particular topic. In the following example, the sidebar
contains some high level summary data, such as the number of documents
in a category.

### Body {.unnumbered}

The body of a dashboard contains the information selected via a sidebar.
It can contained multiple panes, as shown in the following example, that
display information in a variety of ways. The body of the following
dashboard contains four types of visuals (a multiple time series graph,
a donut style pie chart, a map, and a relationship network). It also
shows a list of documents satisfying the specified criteria and a word
cloud of these documents.

I encourage you to visit the [ecoresearch.net dashboard](http://www.ecoresearch.net/climate/). It is an
exemplar and will give you some idea of the diversity of ways in which
information can be presented and the power of a dashboard to inform.

## Designing a dashboard {.unnumbered}

The purpose of a dashboard is to communicate, so the first step is to
work with the client to determine the key performance indicators (KPIs),
visuals, or text that should be on the dashboard. Your client will have
some ideas as to what is required, and by asking good questions and
prototyping, you can clarify needs.

You will need to establish that high quality data sources are available
for conversion into the required information. If data are not available,
you will have to work with other IS professionals to establish them, or
you might conclude that it is infeasible to try to meet some
requirements. You should keep the client informed as you work through
the process of resolving data source issues. Importantly, you should
make the client aware of any data quality problems. Sometimes your
client might have to settle for less than desirable data quality in
order to get some idea of directional swings.

Try several ways of visualizing data to learn what suits the client. The
ggplot2 package works well with shinydashboard, the dashboard package we
will learn. Also, other R packages, such as [dygraphs](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/), can be deployed
for graphing time series, a frequent dashboard element for showing
trends and turning points. Where possible, use interactivity to enable
the client to customize as required (e.g., let the client select the
period of a time series).

Design for ease of navigation and information retrieval. Simplicity
should generally be preferred to complexity. Try to get chunks of
information that should be viewed at the same time on the same page, and
put other collections of cohesive information on separate tabs.

Use colors consistently and in accord with general practice. For
example, red is the standard color for danger, so a red information box
should contain only data that indicate a key problem (e.g., a machine
not working or a major drop in a KPI). Consistency in color usage can
support rapid scanning of a dashboard to identify the attention
demanding situations.

Study dashboards that are considered as exhibiting leading business
practices or are acknowledged as exemplars. Adopt or imitate the
features that work well.

Build a prototype as soon as you have a reasonable idea of what you
think is required and release it to your client. This will enable the
client to learn what is possible and for you to get a deeper
understanding of the needs. Learn from the response to the prototype,
redesign, and release version 2. Continue this process for a couple of
iterations until the dashboard is accepted.

## Dashboards with R {.unnumbered}

R requires two packages, [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) and [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
to create a dashboard. Also, you must use RStudio to run your R script. Shiny is a R
package for building interactive web applications in R. It was
contributed to the R project by [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). It does not require knowledge
of traditional web development tools such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
Shinydashboard uses Shiny to create dashboards, but you you don't need
to learn Shiny. Examining some [examples](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/examples.html) of
dashboards built with shinydashboard will give you an idea of what is
feasible.

### The basics {.unnumbered}

In keeping with the style of this book, we will start by creating a
minimalist dashboard without any content. There are three elements:
header, sidebar, and body. It this case, they are all null. Together,
these three elements create the UI (user interface) of a dashboard page.
The dynamic side of the page, the server, is also null. A dashboard is a
Shiny app, and the final line of code runs the application.

A UI script defines the layout and appearance of dashboard's web page.
The server script contains commands to run the dashboard app and to make
a page dynamic.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
header <- dashboardHeader()
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar()
body <- dashboardBody()
ui <- dashboardPage(header,sidebar,body)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

When you select all the code and run it, a new browser window will open
and display a blank dashboard.

![](Figures/Chapter%2019/dashboard-1.png)

When you inspect some shinydashboard code, you will sometimes see a
different format in which commands are deeply embedded in other
commands. The following code illustrates this approach. I suggest you
avoid it because it is harder to debug such code, especially when you
are a novice.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

### Terminating a dashboard {.unnumbered}

A dashboard is meant to be a dynamic web page that is updated when
refreshed or when some element of the page is clicked on. It remains
active until terminated. This means that when you want to test a new
version of a dashboard or run another one, you must first stop the
current one. You will need to click the stop icon on the console's top
left to terminate a dashboard and close its web page.

### A header and a body {.unnumbered}

We now add some content to a basic dashboard by giving it a header and a
body. This page reports the share price of Apple, which has the stock
exchange symbol of AAPL. The getQuote function[^dashboards-2] of the
[quantmod](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/index.html)
package returns the latest price, with about a two hour delay, every
time the page is opened or refreshed. Notice the use of paste to
concatenate a title and value.

[^dashboards-2]: getQuote returns a dataframe, containing eight values: Trade Time, Last, Change, %Change, Open, High, Low, Volume. For example, getQuote('AAPL')$`%Change` returns the percentage change in price since the daily opening price.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(quantmod)
header <- dashboardHeader(title = 'Apple stock watch')
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar()
body <- dashboardBody(paste('Latest price ',getQuote('AAPL')$Last))
ui <- dashboardPage(header,sidebar,body)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

![](Figures/Chapter%2019/dashboard-2.png)

### Boxes and rows {.unnumbered}

Boxes are the building blocks of a dashboard, and they can be assembled
into rows or columns. The fluidRow function is used to place boxes into
rows and columns. The following code illustrates the use of fluidRow.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(quantmod)
header <- dashboardHeader(title = 'Apple stock watch')
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar()
boxLatest <- box(title = 'Latest price: ',getQuote('AAPL')$Last, background = 'blue' )
boxChange <-  box(title = 'Change ',getQuote('AAPL')$Change, background = 'red' )
row <- fluidRow(boxLatest,boxChange)
body <- dashboardBody(row)
ui <- dashboardPage(header,sidebar,body)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

![](Figures/Chapter%2019/dashboard-3.png)

> Add three more boxes (e.g., high price) to the dashboard just created.

### Multicolumn layout {.unnumbered}

Shinydashboard is based on dividing up the breadth of a web page into 12
units, assuming it is wide enough. Thus, a box with width = 6 will take
up half a page. The tops of the boxes in each row will be aligned, but
the bottoms may not be because of the volume of data they contain. The
fluidRows function ensures that a row's elements appear on the same
line, if the browser has adequate width.

You can also specify that boxes are placed in columns. The column
function defines how much horizontal space, within the 12-unit width
grid, each element should occupy.

In the following code, note how:

- a background for a box is defined (e.g., background='navy');

- five boxes are organized into two columns (rows \<- fluidRow(col1,col2));

- volume of shares traded is formatted with commas (formatC(getQuote('AAPL')$Volume,big.mark=',').

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(quantmod)
header <- dashboardHeader(title = 'Apple stock watch')
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar()
boxLast <-  box(title = 'Latest', width=NULL, getQuote('AAPL')$Last, background='navy')
boxHigh <-  box(title = 'High', width=NULL, getQuote('AAPL')$High , background='light-blue')
boxVolume <- box(title = 'Volume', width=NULL, formatC(getQuote('AAPL')$Volume,big.mark=','), background='aqua')
boxChange <-  box(title = 'Change', width=NULL, getQuote('AAPL')$Change, background='light-blue')
boxLow <-  box(title = 'Low', width=NULL, getQuote('AAPL')$Low, background='light-blue')
col1 <-  column(width = 4,boxLast,boxHigh,boxVolume)
col2 <-  column(width = 4,boxChange,boxLow)
rows <- fluidRow(col1,col2)
body <- dashboardBody(rows)
ui <- dashboardPage(header,sidebar,body)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

![](Figures/Chapter%2019/dashboard-4.png)

### Sidebar {.unnumbered}

A sidebar is typically used to enable quick navigation of a dashboard's
features. It can contain layers of menus, and by clicking on a menu link
or icon, the dashboard can display different content in the body area.

A library of icons is available
[Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) and
[Glyphicons](https://www.glyphicons.com) for use in the
creation of a dashboard.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(quantmod)
header <-  dashboardHeader(title = 'Stock watch')
menuApple <-  menuItem("Apple", tabName = "Apple", icon = icon("dashboard"))
menuGoogle <- menuItem("Google", tabName = "Google", icon = icon("dashboard"))
sidebar <-  dashboardSidebar(sidebarMenu(menuApple, menuGoogle))
tabApple <-  tabItem(tabName = "Apple", getQuote('AAPL')$Last)
tabGoogle <-  tabItem(tabName = "Google", getQuote('GOOG')$Last)
tabs <-  tabItems(tabApple,tabGoogle)
body <-  dashboardBody(tabs)
ui <- dashboardPage(header, sidebar, body)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

For the following dashboard, by clicking on Apple, you get its latest
share price, and similarly for Google.

![](Figures/Chapter%2019/dashboard-5.png)

### Infobox {.unnumbered}

An infobox is often used to display a single measure, such as a KPI.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(quantmod)
header <- dashboardHeader(title = 'Apple stock watch')
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar()
infoLatest <- infoBox(title = 'Latest', icon('dollar'), getQuote('AAPL')$Last, color='red')
infoChange <- infoBox(title = 'Web site', icon('apple'),href='http://investor.apple.com', color='purple')
row <- fluidRow(width=4,infoLatest,infoChange)
body <- dashboardBody(row)
ui <- dashboardPage(header,sidebar,body)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server))
```

The following dashboard shows the latest price for Apple's shares. By
clicking on the purple infobox, you access Apple investors' web site.

![](Figures/Chapter%2019/dashboard-6.png)

### Dynamic dashboards {.unnumbered}

Dashboards are more useful when they give managers access to determine
what is presented. The server function supports dynamic dashboards and
executes when a dashboard is opened or refreshed.

The following basic dashboard illustrates how a server function is
specified and how it communicates with the user interface. Using the
time series graphing package, dygraphs, it creates a dashboard showing
the closing price for Apple. Key points to note:

- The ui function indicates that it wants to create a graph with the code
`dygraphOutput('apple')`.

- The server executes `output$apple <- renderDygraph({dygraph(Cl(get(getSymbols('AAPL'))))}) `
to produce the graph.

- The linkage between the UI and the server functions is through the
highlighted code, as shown in the preceding two bullets and the
following code block.

- The text parameter of `dynagraphOutput()` in the UI function must match the text following `output$` in the server function.

- The data to be graphed are retrieved with the Cl function of the quantmod package.[^dashboards-3]

[^dashboards-3]: The quantmod function getSymbols('X') returns an time series object named X. The get function retrieves the name of the object and passes it to the Cl function and then the time series is graphed by dygraph. The code is a bit complicated, but necessary to generalize it for use with an interactive dashboard.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(quantmod)
library(dygraphs) # graphic package for time series
header <-  dashboardHeader(title = 'Apple stock watch')
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar(NULL)
boxPrice <- box(title='Closing share price', width = 12, height = NULL, dygraphOutput('apple'))
body <-   dashboardBody(fluidRow(boxPrice))
ui <- dashboardPage(header, sidebar, body)
server <- function(input, output) {
# quantmod retrieves closing price as a time series
output$apple <- renderDygraph({dygraph(Cl(get(getSymbols('AAPL'))))})
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

When you create the dashboard, mouse over the points on the graph and
observe the data that are reported.

![](Figures/Chapter%2019/dashboard-7.png)

The following code illustrates how to create a dashboard that enables an
analyst to graph the closing share price for Apple, Google, or Ford.
Important variables in the code have been highlighted so you can easily
see the correspondence between the UI and server functions. Note:

- The use of a selection list to pick one of three companies
  (`selectInput("symbol", "Equity:", choices = c("Apple" = "AAPL", "Ford" = "F", "Google" = "GOOG"))`).

- When an analyst selects one of the three firms, its stock exchange
  symbol (symbol) is passed to the server function.

- The value of symbol is used to retrieve the time series for the
  stock and to generate the graphic (chart ) for display with
  `boxSymbol`. The symbol is also inserted into a text string (text) for display with `boxOutput`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(quantmod)
library(dygraphs)
header <-  dashboardHeader(title = 'Stock watch')
sidebar <- dashboardSidebar(NULL)
boxSymbol <-  box(selectInput("symbol", "Equity:", choices = c("Apple" = "AAPL",  "Ford" = "F", "Google" = "GOOG"), selected = 'AAPL'))
boxPrice <- box(title='Closing price', width = 12, height = NULL, dygraphOutput("chart"))
boxOutput <-  box(textOutput("text"))
body <-   dashboardBody(fluidRow(boxSymbol, boxOutput, boxPrice))
ui <- dashboardPage(header, sidebar, body)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$text <- renderText({
    paste("Symbol is:",input$symbol)
  })
# Cl in quantmod retrieves closing price as a time series
output$chart <- renderDygraph({dygraph(Cl(get(input$symbol)))}) # graph time series
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The following dashboard shows the pull down list in the top left for
selecting an equity. The equity's symbol is then displayed in the top
right box, and a time series of its closing price appears in the box
occupying the entire second row.

![](Figures/Chapter%2019/dashboard-8.png)

### Input options {.unnumbered}

The preceding example illustrates the use of a selectInput function to
select an equity from a list. There are other input options available,
and these are listed in the following table.

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

This chapter has introduced you to the basic structure and use of
shinydashboard. It has many options, and you will need to consult the
online [documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
and examples to learn more about creating dashboards.

### Summary {.unnumbered}

A dashboard is a web page or mobile app screen that is designed to
present important information in an easy to comprehend and primarily
visual format. A dashboard consists of a header, sidebar, and body.
Shinydashboard is an R package based on shiny that facilitates the
creation of interactive real-time dashboards. It must be used in
conjunction with RStudio.

## Exercises {.unnumbered}

1.  Create a dashboard to show the current conditions and temperatures
    in both Fahrenheit and Celsius at a location. Your will need the
    [rwunderground](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rwunderground/index.html)
    package and [an API key](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs).

2. Revise the dashboard created in the prior exercise to allow someone
    to select from up to five cities to get the weather details for that
    city.

3. Extend the previous dashboard. If the temperature is about 30ºC
    (86ºF), code the server function to give both temperature boxes a red
    background, and if it is below 10ºC (50ºF) give both a blue
    background. Otherwise the color should be yellow.

4. Use the WDI package to access World Bank Data and create a dashboard
    for a country of your choosing. Show three or more of the most
    current measures of the state of the selected country as an
    information box.

5. Use the WDI package to access World Bank Data for China, India, and
    the US for three variables, (1) CO2 emissions (metric tons per
    capita), (2) Electric power consumption (kWh per capita), and (3)
    forest area (% of land area). The corresponding WDI codes are:
    EN.ATM.CO2E.PC, EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC, and AG.LND.FRST.ZS. Set up a
    dashboard so that a person can select the country from a pull down
    list and then the data for that country are shown in three
    infoboxes.

6. Use the WDI package to access World Bank Data for China, India, and
    the US for three variables, (1) CO2 emissions (metric tons per
    capita), (2) Electric power consumption (kWh per capita), and (3)
    forest area (% of land area). The corresponding WDI codes are:
    EN.ATM.CO2E.PC, EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC, and AG.LND.FRST.ZS. Set up a
    dashboard so that a person can select one of the three measures, and
    then the data for each country are shown in separate infoboxes.

7. Create a dashboard to:

    a.  Show the conversion rate between two currencies using the quantmod
        package to retrieve exchange rates. Let a person select from one of
        five currencies using a drop down box;

    b.  Show the value of input amount when converted one of the selected
        currencies to the other selected currency;

    c.  Show the exchange rate between the two selected currencies over the
        last 100 days

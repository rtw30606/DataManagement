### Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

Students completing this chapter will be able to

-   define the purpose of XML;

-   create an XML schema;

-   code data in XML format;

-   create an XML stylesheet;

-   discuss data management options for XML documents.

### Introduction {.unnumbered}

There are four central problems in data management: capture, storage,
retrieval, and exchange. The focus for most of this book has been on
storage (i.e., data modeling) and retrieval (i.e., SQL). Now it is time
to consider capture and exchange. Capture has always been an important
issue, and the guiding principle is to capture data once in the cheapest
possible manner.

## SGML {.unnumbered}

The Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) was designed to reduce
the cost and increase the efficiency of document management. Its child,
XML, has essentially replaced SGML. For example, the second edition of
the *Oxford English Dictionary* was specified in SGML, and the third
edition is stored in XML format.[^xml-1]

[^xml-1]: Cowlishaw, M. F. (1987). Lexx---a programmable structured editor.
    *IBM Journal of Research and Development*, 31(1), 73-80.

A markup language embeds information about a document in the text. In
the following table, the markup tags indicate that the text contains CD
liner notes. Note also that the titles and identifiers of the mentioned
CDs are explicitly identified.

*Markup language*

```{sgml, eval = FALSE}
<cdliner>This uniquely creative collaboration between Miles Davis and Gil Evans has already resulted in two extraordinary albums—<cdtitle>Miles Ahead</cdtitle><cdid>CL 1041</cdid> and <cdtitle>Porgy and Bess</cdtitle><cdid>CL 1274</cdid>.</cdliner>
```

SGML is an International Standard (ISO 8879) that defines the structure
of documents. It is a vendor-independent language that supports
cross-system portability and publication for all media. Developed in
1986 to manage software documentation, SGML was widely accepted as the
markup language for a number of information-intensive industries. As a
metalanguage, SGML is the mother of both HTML and XML.

SGML illustrates four major advantages a markup language provides for
data management:

-   **Reuse**: Information can be created once and reused over and over.
    By storing critical documents in markup format, firms do not need to
    duplicate efforts when there are changes to documents. For example,
    a firm might store all its legal contracts in SGML.

-   **Flexibility**: SGML documents can be published in any medium for a
    wide variety of audiences. Because SGML is content-oriented,
    presentation decisions are delayed until the output format is known.
    Thus, the same content could be printed, presented on the Web in
    HTML, or written to a DVD as a PDF.

-   **Revision**: SGML enhances control over revision and enables
    version control. When stored in an SGML database, original data are
    archived alongside any changes. That means you know exactly what the
    original document contained and what changes were made.

-   **Format independence**: SGML files are stored as text and can be
    read by many programs on all operating systems. Thus, it preserves
    textual information independent of how and when it is presented.
    SGML protects a firm's investment in documentation for the long
    term. Because it is now possible to display documentation using
    multiple media (e.g., Web and iPad), firms have become sensitized to
    the need to store documents in a single, independent manner that can
    then be converted for display by a particular medium.

SGML's power is derived from its recording of both text and the meaning
of that text. A short section of SGML demonstrates clearly the features
and strength of SGML. The tags surrounding a chunk of text describe its
meaning and thus support presentation and retrieval. For example, the
pair of tags \<title\> and \</title\> surrounding "XML: Managing Data
Exchange" indicates that it is the chapter title.

*SGML code*

```{sgml, eval = FALSE}
<chapter>
<no>18</no>
<title>XML: Managing Data Exchange</title>
<section>
<quote><emph type = '2'>Words can have no single fixed meaning. Like wayward electrons, they can spin away from their initial orbit and enter a wider magnetic field. No one owns them or has a proprietary right to dictate how they will be used.</emph>
</quote>
</section>
</chapter>
```

Taking this piece of SGML, it is possible, using an appropriate
stylesheet, to create a print version where the title of the chapter is
displayed in Times, 16 point, bold, or a HTML version where the title is
displayed in red, Georgia, 14 point, italics. Furthermore, the database
in which this text is stored can be searched for any chapters that
contain "Exchange" in their title.

Now, consider the case where the text is stored as HTML. How do you,
with complete certainty, identify the chapter title? Do you extract all
text contained by \<h1\> and \</h1\> tags? You will then retrieve "18"
as a possible chapter title. What happens if there is other text
displayed using \<h1\> and \</h1\> tags? The problem with HTML is that
it defines presentation and has very little meaning. A similar problem
exists for documents prepared with a word processor.

*HTML code*

```{html, eval = FALSE}
<html>
<body>
<h1><b>18 </b></h1>
<h1><b>XML: Managing Data Exchange</b></h1>
<p><i>Words can have no single fixed meaning. Like wayward electrons, they can spin away from their initial orbit and enter a wider magnetic field. No one owns them or has a proprietary right to dictate how they will be used.</i>
</body>
</html>
```

By using embedded tags to record meaning, SGML makes a document
platform-independent and greatly improves the effectiveness of
searching. Despite its many advantages, there are some features of SGML
that make implementation difficult and also limit the ability to create
tools for information management and exchange. As a result, XML, a
derivative of SGML, was developed.

## XML {.unnumbered}

Extensible Markup Language (XML), a language designed to make
information self-describing, retains the core ideas of SGML. You can
think of XML as SGML for electronic and mobile commerce. Since the
definition of XML was completed in early 1998 by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), the standard has spread rapidly because it solves a
critical data management problem. XML is a metalanguage---a language to
generate languages.

Despite having the same parent, there are major differences between XML
and HTML.

*XML vs. HTML*

| XML                                   | HTML                                |
|:--------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Structured text                       | Formatted text                      |
| User-definable structure (extensible) | Predefined formats (not extensible) |
| Context-sensitive retrieval           | Limited retrieval                   |
| Greater hypertext linking             | Limited hypertext linking           |

HTML, an electronic-publishing language, describes how a Web browser
should display text and images on a computer screen. It tells the
browser nothing about the meaning of the data. For example, the browser
does not know whether a piece of text represents a price, a product
code, or a delivery date. Humans infer meaning from the context (e.g.,
August 8, 2012, is recognized as a date). Given the explosive growth of
the Web, HTML clearly works well enough for exchanging data between
computers and humans. It does not, however, work for exchanging data
between computers, because computers are not smart enough to deduce
meaning from context.

Successful data exchange requires that the meaning of the exchanged data
be readily determined by a computer. The XML solution is to embed tags
in a file to describe the data (e.g., insert tags into an order to
indicate attributes such as price, size, quantity, and color). A
browser, or program for that matter, can then recognize this document as
a customer order. Consequently, it can do far more than just display the
price. For example, it can convert all prices to another currency. More
importantly, the data can be exchanged between computers and understood
by the receiving system.

XML consists of rules (that anyone can follow to create a markup
language (e.g., a markup language for financial data such as XBRL).
Hence, the "eXtensible" in the XML name, indicating that the language
can be easily extended to include new tags. In contrast, HTML is not
extensible and its set of tags is fixed, which is one of the major
reasons why HTML is easy to learn. The XML rules ensure that a type of
computer program known as a parser can process any extension or addition
of new tags.

*XML rules*

-   Elements must have both an opening and a closing tag.

-   Elements must follow a strict hierarchy with only one root element.

-   Elements must not overlap other elements.

-   Element names must obey XML naming conventions.

-   XML is case sensitive.

Consider the credit card company that wants to send you your latest
statement via the Internet so that you can load it into your financial
management program. Since this is a common problem for credit card
companies and financial software authors, these industry groups have
combined to create Open Financial Exchange (OFX),[^xml-2] a language for the
exchange of financial data across the Internet.

[^xml-2]: <http://www.ofx.net>

XML has a small number of rules. Tags always come in pairs, as in HTML.
A pair of tags surrounds each piece of data (e.g.,
\<price\>89.12\</price\>) to indicate its meaning, whereas in HTML ,they
indicate how the data are presented. Tag pairs can be nested inside one
another to multiple levels, which effectively creates a tree or
hierarchical structure. Because XML uses Unicode (see the discussion in
Chapter 11), it enables the exchange of information not only between
different computer systems, but also across language boundaries.

The differences between HTML and XML are captured in the following
examples for each markup language. Note that in the following table,
HTML incorporates formatting instructions (i.e., the course code is
bold), whereas XML describes the meaning of the data.

*Comparison of HTML and XML coding*

+--------------------------+------------------------------------+
| HTML                     | XML                                |
+==========================+====================================+
| \<p\>\<b\>MIST7600\</b\> | \<course\>                         |
|                          |                                    |
| Data Management\<br\>    | \<code\>MIST7600\</code\>          |
|                          |                                    |
| 3 credit hours\</p\>     | \<title\>Data Management\</title\> |
|                          |                                    |
| \</course\>              | \<credit\>3\</credit\>             |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------+

XML enables a shift of processing from the server to the browser. At
present, most processing has to be done by the server because that is
where knowledge about the data is stored. The browser knows nothing
about the data and therefore can only present but not process. However,
when XML is implemented, the browser can take on processing that
previously had to be handled by the server.

Imagine that you are selecting a shirt from a mail-order catalog. The
merchant's Web server sends you data on 20 shirts (100 Kbytes of text
and images) with prices in U.S. dollars. If you want to see the prices
in euros, the calculation will be done by the server, and the full
details for the 20 shirts retransmitted (i.e., another 100 Kbytes are
sent from the server to the browser). However, once XML is in place, all
that needs to be sent from the server to the browser is the conversion
rate of U.S. dollars to euros and a program to compute the conversion at
the browser end. In most cases, less data will be transmitted between a
server and browser when XML is in place. Consequently, widespread
adoption of XML will reduce network traffic.

*Execution of HTML and XML code*

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| HTML                              | XML                               |
+===================================+===================================+
| Retrieve shirt data with prices   | Retrieve shirt data with prices   |
| in USD.                           | in USD.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
| Retrieve shirt data with prices   | Retrieve conversion rate of USD   |
| in EUR.                           | to EUR.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Retrieve Java program to convert  |
|                                   | currencies.                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Compute prices in EUR.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

XML can also make searching more efficient and effective. At present,
search engines look for matching text strings, and consequently return
many links that are completely irrelevant. For instance, if you are
searching for details on the Nomad speaker system, and specify "nomad"
as the sought text string, you will get links to many items that are of
no interest (e.g., The Fabulous Nomads Surf Band). Searching will be
more precise when you can specify that you are looking for a product
name that includes the text "nomad." The search engine can then confine
its attention to text contained with the tags \<productname\> and
\</productname\>, assuming these tags are the XML standard for
representing product names.

The major expected gains from the introduction of XML are

-   Store once and format many ways---Data stored in XML format can be
    extracted and reformatted for multiple presentation styles (e.g.,
    printed report, DVD).

-   Hardware and software independence---One format is valid for all
    systems. Capture once and exchange many times---Data are captured as
    close to the source as possible and never again (i.e., no rekeying).

-   Accelerated targeted searching---Searches are more precise and
    faster because they use XML tags.

-   Less network congestion---The processing load shifts from the server
    to the browser.

### XML language design {.unnumbered}

XML lets developers design application-specific vocabularies. To create
a new language, designers must agree on three things:

-   The allowable tags

-   The rules for nesting tagged elements

-   Which tagged elements can be processed

The first two, the language's vocabulary and structure, are typically
defined in an XML schema. Developers use the XML schema to understand
the meaning of tags so they can write software to process an XML file.

XML tags describe meaning, independent of the display medium. An XML
stylesheet, another set of rules, defines how an XML file is
automatically formatted for various devices. This set of rules is called
an Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). Stylesheets allow data to be
rendered in a variety of ways, such as Braille or audio for visually
impaired people.

### XML schema {.unnumbered}

An XML schema (or just schema for brevity) is an XML file associated
with an XML document that informs an application how to interpret markup
tags and valid formats for tags. The advantage of a schema is that it
leads to standardization. Consistently named and defined tags create
conformity and support organizational efficiency. They avoid the
confusion and loss of time when the meaning of data is not clear. Also,
when validation information is built into a schema, some errors are
detected before data are exchanged.

XML does not require the creation of a schema. If a document is well
formed, XML will interpret it correctly. A well-formed document follows
XML syntax and has tags that are correctly nested.

A schema is a very strict specification, and any errors will be detected
when parsing. A schema defines:

-   The names and contents of all elements that are permissible in a
    certain document

-   The structure of the document

-   How often an element may appear

-   The order in which the elements must appear

-   The type of data the element can contain

#### DOM {.unnumbered}

The **Document Object Model** (DOM) is the model underlying XML. It is
based on a tree (i.e., it directly supports one-to-one and one-to-many,
but not many-to-many relationships). A document is modeled as a
hierarchical collection of nodes that have parent/child relationships.
The node is the primary object and can be of different types (such as
document, element, attribute, text). Each document has a single document
node, which has no parent, and zero or more children that are element
nodes. It is a good practice to create a visual model of the XML
document and then convert this to a schema, which is XML's formal
representation of the DOM.

At this point, an example is the best way to demonstrate XML, schema,
and DOM concepts. We will use the familiar CD problem that was
introduced in Chapter 3. In keeping with the style of this text, we
define a minimal amount of XML to get you started, and then more
features are added once you have mastered the basics.

### CD library case {.unnumbered}

The CD library case gradually develops, over several chapters, a data
model for recording details of a CD collection, culminating in the model
at the end of Chapter 6. Unfortunately, we cannot quickly convert this
final model to an XML document model, because a DOM is based on a tree
model. Thus, we must start afresh.

The model , in this case, is based on the observation that a CD library
has many CDs, and a CD has many tracks.

*CD library tree data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%2018/CD.png)

A model is then mapped into a schema using the following procedure.

-   Each entity becomes a complex element type.

-   Each data model attribute becomes a simple element type.

-   The one-to-many (1:m) relationship is recorded as a sequence.

The schema for the CD library follows. For convenience of exposition,
the source code lines have been numbered, but these numbers are not part
of a schema.[^xml-3]

[^xml-3]: You should use an XML editor for creating XML files. I have not
    found a good open source product. Among the commercial products, my
    preference is for [Oxygen,](http://www.oxygenxml.com/) which you can
    get for a 30 days trial.

*Schema for CD library (cdlib.xsd)*

```{XML, eval = FALSE}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsd:schema xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'>
<!--CD library-->
	<xsd:element name="cdlibrary">
		<xsd:complexType>
			<xsd:sequence>
				<xsd:element name="cd" type="cdType" minOccurs="1" 
					maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
			</xsd:sequence>
		</xsd:complexType>
	</xsd:element>
<!--CD-->
	<xsd:complexType name="cdType">
		<xsd:sequence>
			<xsd:element name="cdid" type="xsd:string"/>
			<xsd:element name="cdlabel" type="xsd:string"/>
			<xsd:element name="cdtitle" type="xsd:string"/>
			<xsd:element name="cdyear" type="xsd:integer"/>
			<xsd:element name="track" type="trackType" minOccurs="1" 
					maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
		</xsd:sequence>
	</xsd:complexType>
<!--Track-->
	<xsd:complexType name="trackType">
		<xsd:sequence>
			<xsd:element name="trknum" type="xsd:integer"/>
			<xsd:element name="trktitle" type="xsd:string"/>
			<xsd:element name="trklen" type="xsd:time"/>
		</xsd:sequence>
	</xsd:complexType>
</xsd:schema>
```

There are several things to observe about the schema.

-   All XML documents begin with an XML declaration {1}.[^xml-4] The
    encoding attribute (i.e., encoding="UTF-8") specifies what form of
    Unicode is used (in this case the 8-bit form).

-   The XSD Schema namespace[^xml-5] is declared {2}.

-   Comments are placed inside the tag pair \<!-- and --\> {3}.

-   The CD library is defined {4--10} as a complex element type, which
    essentially means that it can have embedded elements, which are a
    sequence of CDs in this case.

-   A sequence is a series of child elements embedded in a parent, as
    illustrated by a CD library containing a sequence of CDs {7}, and a
    CD containing elements of CD identifier, label, and so forth
    {15--20}. The order of a sequence must be maintained by any XML
    document based on the schema.

-   A sequence can have a specified range of elements. In this case,
    there must be at least one CD (minOccurs="1") but there is no upper
    limit (maxOccurs= "unbounded") on how many CDs there can be in the
    library {7}.

-   An element that has a child (e.g., cdlibrary, which is at the 1 end
    of a 1:m) or possesses attributes (e.g., track) is termed a complex
    element type.

-   A CD is represented by a complex element type {13--20}, and has the
    name cdType {13}.

-   The element cd is defined by specifying the name of the complex type
    (i.e., cdType) containing its specification {7}.

-   A track is represented by a complex type because it contains
    elements of track number, title, and length {24--30}. The name of
    this complex type is trackType {24}.

-   Notice the reference within the definition of cd to the complex type
    trackType, used to specify the element track {19}.

-   Simple types (e.g., cdid and cdyear) do not contain any elements,
    and thus the type of data they store must be defined. Thus, cdid is
    a text string and cdyear is an integer.

[^xml-4]: In this chapter, numbers in {} refer to line numbers in the
    corresponding XML code.

[^xml-5]: A namespace is a collection of valid names of attributes, types,
    and elements for a schema. Think of a namespace as a dictionary.

The purpose of a schema is to define the contents and structure of an
XML file. It is also used to verify that an XML file has a valid
structure and that all elements in the XML file are defined in the
schema.

If you use an editor, you can possibly create a visual view of the
schema.

*A visual depiction of a schema as created by Oxygen*

![](Figures/Chapter%2018/xmlvisual.png)

Some common data types are shown in the following table. The meaning is
obvious in most cases for those familiar with SQL, except for
uriReference. A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a generalization of
the URL concept.

*Some common data types*

| Data type |
|:----------|
| string    |
| boolean   |
| anyURI    |
| decimal   |
| float     |
| integer   |
| time      |
| date      |

We can now use the recently defined CDlibrary schema to describe a small
CD library containing the CD information given in the following table.

*Data for a small CD library*

The XML for describing the CD library follows. There are several things
to observe:

-   All XML documents begin with an XML declaration.

-   The declaration immediately following the XML declaration identifies
    the root element of the document (i.e., cdlibrary) and the schema
    (i.e., cdlib.xsd).

-   Details of a CD are enclosed by the tags \<cd\> and \</cd\>.

-   Details of a track are enclosed by the tags \<track\> and
    \</track\>.

*XML for describing a CD (cdlib.xml)*

```{XML, eval = FALSE}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

        </track>
    </cd>
</cdlibrary>
```

As you now realize, the definition of an XML document is relatively
straightforward. It is a bit tedious with all the typing of tags to
surround each data element. Fortunately, there are XML editors that
relieve this tedium.

#### XSL {.unnumbered}

As you now know from the prior exercise, the browser display of XML is
not particularly useful. What is missing is a stylesheet that tells the
browser how to display an XML file. The eXtensible Stylesheet Language
(XSL) is used for defining the rendering of an XML file. An XSL document
defines the rules for presenting an XML document's data. XSL is an
application of XML, and an XSL file is also an XML file.

The power of XSL is demonstrated by applying the stylesheet that follows
to the preceding XML.

*Result of applying a stylesheet to CD library data*

![](Figures/Chapter%2013/cd-library-stylesheets.png)

*Stylesheet for displaying an XML file of CD data (cdlib.xsl)*

```{XLM, eval = FALSE}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" 
		xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
	<xsl:output encoding="UTF-8" indent="yes" method=“html" />
	<xsl:template match="/">
	<html>
		<head>
			<title> Complete List of Songs </title> 
		</head>
	<body>
		<h1> Complete List of Songs </h1> 
		<xsl:apply-templates select="cdlibrary" />
		</body>
		</html>
	</xsl:template>
	<xsl:template match="cdlibrary">
		<xsl:for-each select="cd">
			<br/>
			<font color="maroon"> 
				<xsl:value-of select="cdtitle" />
				, 
				<xsl:value-of select="cdlabel" />
				, 
				<xsl:value-of select="cdyear" />
				[ 
				<xsl:value-of select="cdid" />
				] </font> 
			<br/>
			<table>
				<xsl:for-each select="track">
					<tr>
						<td align="left">
							<xsl:value-of select="trknum" />
						</td>
						<td>
							<xsl:value-of select="trktitle" />
						</td>
						<td align="center">
							<xsl:value-of select="trklen" />
						</td>
					</tr>
				</xsl:for-each>
			</table>
			<br/>
		</xsl:for-each>
	</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
```

To use a stylesheet with an XML file, you must add a line of code to
point to the stylesheet file. In this case, you add the following:

```{XML, eval = FALSE}
<?xml-stylesheet type=”text/xsl” href=”cdlib.xsl” media=”screen”?>
```

as the second line of cdlib.xml (i.e., it appears before \<cdlibrary ...
\>). The added line of code points to cdlib.xsl as the stylesheet. This
means that when the browser loads cdlib.xml, it uses the contents of
cdlib.xsl to determine how to render the contents of cdlib.xml.

We now need to examine the contents of cdlib.xsl so that you can learn
some basics of creating XSL commands. You will soon notice that all XSL
commands are preceded by xsl:

-   Tell the browser it is processing an XML file {1}

-   Specify that the file is a stylesheet {2}

-   Specify a template, which identifies which elements should be
    processed and how they are processed. The match attribute {4}
    indicates the template applies to the source node. Process the
    template {11} defined in the file {15--45}. A stylesheet can specify
    multiple templates to produce different reports from the same XML
    input.

-   Specify a template to be applied when the XSL processor encounters
    the \<cdlibrary\> node {15}.

-   Create an outer loop for processing each CD {16--44}.

-   Define the values to be reported for each CD (i.e., title, label,
    year, and id) {19, 21, 23, 25}. The respective XSL commands select
    the values. For example, \<xsl:value-of select="cdtitle" /\>
    specifies selection of cdtitle.

-   Create an inner loop for processing the tracks on a particular CD
    {29--41}.

-   Present the track data in tabular form using HTML table commands
    interspersed with XSL {28--42}.

### Converting XML {.unnumbered}

There are occasions when there is a need to convert an XML file:

-   **Transformation**: conversion from one XML vocabulary to another
    (e.g., between financial languages FPML and finML)

-   **Manipulation**: reordering, filtering, or sorting parts of a
    document

-   **Rendering in another language**: rendering the XML file using
    another format

You have already seen how XSL can be used to transform XML for rendering
as HTML. The original XSL has been split into three languages:

-   XSLT for transformation and manipulation

-   XSLT for rendition

-   XPath for accessing the structure of an XML file

For a data management course, this is as far as you need to go with
learning about XSL. Just remember that you have only touched the
surface. To become proficient in XML, you will need an entire course on
the topic.

## XPath for navigating an XML document {.unnumbered}

XPath is a navigation language for an XML document. It defines how to
select nodes or sets of nodes in a document. The first step to
understanding XPath is to know about the different types of nodes. In
the following XML document, the document node is \<cdlibrary\> {1},
\<trktitle\>Vendome\</trktitle\> {9} is an example of an element node,
and \<track length="00:02:30"\> {7} is an instance of an attribute node.

*An XML document*

```{XML, eval = FALSE}
<cdlibrary>
	<cd>
 		<cdid>A2 1325</cdid>
		<cdlabel>Atlantic</cdlabel>
		<cdtitle>Pyramid</cdtitle>
		<cdyear>1960</cdyear>
		<track length="00:02:30">
			<trknum>1</trknum>
			<trktitle>Vendome</trktitle>
		</track>
		<track length="00:10:46">
			<trknum>2</trknum>
			<trktitle>Pyramid</trktitle>
		</track>
	</cd>
</cdlibrary>
```

### A family of nodes {.unnumbered}

Each element and attribute has one **parent node**. In the preceding XML
document, cd is the parent of cdid, cdlabel, cdyear, and track. Element
nodes may have zero or more **children nodes**. Thus cdid, cdlabel,
cdyear, and track are the children of cd. **Ancestor nodes** are the
parent, parent's parent, and so forth of a node. For example, cd and
cdlibrary are ancestors of cdtitle. Similarly, we have **descendant
nodes**, which are the children, children's children, and so on of a
node. The descendants of cd include cdid, cdtitle, track, trknum, and
trktitle. Finally, we have **sibling nodes**, which are nodes that share
a parent. In the sample document, cdid, cdlabel, cdyear, and track are
siblings.

### Navigation examples {.unnumbered}

The examples in the following table give you an idea of how you can use
XPath to extract data from an XML document. Our preference is to answer
such queries using SQL, but if your data are in XML format, then XPath
provides a means of interrogating the file.

*XPath examples*

| Example                                      | Result                                     |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| /cdlibrary/cd[1]                             | Selects the first CD                       |
| //trktitle                                   | Selects all the titles of all tracks       |
| /cdlibrary/cd[last() -1]                     | Selects the second last CD                 |
| /cdlibrary/cd[last()]/track[last()]/trklen T | he length of the last track on the last CD |
| /cdlibrary/cd[cdyear=1960]                   | Selects all CDs released in 1960           |
| /cdlibrary/cd[cdyear\>1950]/cdtitle          | Titles of CDs released after 1950          |

## XQuery for querying an XML document {.unnumbered}

XQuery is a query language for XML, and thus it plays a similar role
that SQL plays for a relational database. It is used for finding and
extracting elements and attributes of an XML document. It builds on
XPath's method for specifying navigation through the elements of an XML
document. As well as being used for querying, XQuery can also be used
for transforming XML to XHTML.

The first step is to specify the location of the XML file. In this case,
we will use the cdlib.xml file, which is stored on the web site for this
book. Using XPath notation it is relatively straightforward to list some
values in an XML file

*List the titles of CDs.*

```{XQuery, eval = FALSE}
doc("http://www.richardtwatson.com/xml/cdlib.xml")/cdlibrary/cd/cdtitle
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cdtitle>Pyramid</cdtitle>
<cdtitle>Ella Fitzgerald</cdtitle>
```

You can also use an XPath expression to select particular information.

*List the titles of CDs released under the Verve label*

```{XQuery, eval = FALSE}
doc("http://www.richardtwatson.com/xml/cdlib.xml")/cdlibrary/cd[cdlabel='Verve']/cdtitle
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cdtitle>Ella Fitzgerald</cdtitle>
```

XQuery commands can also be written using an SQL like structure, which
is called FLWOR, an easy way to remember 'For, Let, Where, Order by,
Return.' Here is an example.

*List the titles of tracks longer than 5 minutes*

```{XQuery, eval = FALSE}
for $x in doc("http://www.richardtwatson.com/xml/cdlib.xml")/cdlibrary/cd/track
where $x/'track length' > "00:05:00"
order by $x/'trktitle'
return $x

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<track>
	<trknum>2</trknum>
	<trktitle>Pyramid</trktitle>
	<trklen>00:10:46</trklen>
</track>
```

If you want to just report the data without the tags, use return
data(\$x).

## XML and databases {.unnumbered}

XML is more than a document-processing technology. It is also a powerful
tool for data management. For database developers, XML can be used to
facilitate middle-tier data integration and schemas. Most of the major
DBMS producers have XML-centric extensions for their product lines.

Many XML documents are stored for the long term, because they are an
important repository of organizational memory. A data exchange language,
XML is a means of moving data between databases, which means a need for
tools for exporting and importing XML.

XML documents can be stored in the same format as you would store a word
processing or HTML file: You just place them in an appropriately named
folder. File systems, however, have limitations that become particularly
apparent when a large number of files need to be stored, as in the
corporate setting.

What is needed is a DBMS for storing, retrieving, and manipulating XML
documents. Such a DBMS should:

-   Be *MISSING CONTENT*

Two possible solutions for XML document management are a relational
database management system (RDBMS) or an XML database.

### RDBMS {.unnumbered}

An XML document can stored within an RDBMS. Storing an intact XML
document as a CLOB is a sensible strategy if the XML document contains
static content that will only be updated by replacing the entire
document. Examples include written text such as articles,
advertisements, books, or legal contracts. These document-centric files
(e.g., articles and legal contracts) are retrieved and updated in their
entirety.

For more dynamic data-centric XML files (e.g., orders, price lists,
airline schedules), the RDBMS must be extended to support the structure
of the data so that portions of the document (e.g., an element such as
the price for a product) can be retrieved and updated.

### XML database {.unnumbered}

A second approach is to build a special-purpose XML database. Tamino[^xml-7]
is an example of such an approach.

[^xml-7]: www.softwareag.com/Corporate/products/wm/tamino/default.asp

## MySQL and XML {.unnumbered}

MySQL has functions for storing, searching, and maintaining XML
documents. Any XML file can be stored as a document, and each XML
fragment is stored as a character string. Creation of a table is
straightforward:

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE cdlib (
	docid 	INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
	doc 		VARCHAR(10000),
	PRIMARY KEY(docid));
```

Insertion of an XML fragment follows the familiar pattern:

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
INSERT INTO cdlib (doc) VALUES
('<cd>
	<cdid>A2 1325</cdid>
	<cdlabel>Atlantic</cdlabel>
	<cdtitle>Pyramid</cdtitle>
	<cdyear>1960</cdyear>
	<track length="00:02:30">
		<trknum>1</trknum>
		<trktitle>Vendome</trktitle>
	</track>
	<track length="00:10:46">
		<trknum>2</trknum>
		<trktitle>Pyramid</trktitle>
	</track>
</cd>');
```

### Querying XML {.unnumbered}

ExtractValue is the MySQL function for retrieving data from a node. It
requires specification of the XML fragment to be retrieved and the XPath
expression to locate the required node.

*Report the title of the first CD in the library*

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT ExtractValue(doc,'/cd/cdtitle[1]') FROM cdlib;
```

| ExtractValue |
|:-------------|
| Pyramid      |

*Report the title of the first track on the first CD.*

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT ExtractValue(doc,'//cd[1]/track[1]/trktitle') FROM cdlib;
```

| ExtractValue |
|:-------------|
| Vendome      |

### Updating XML {.unnumbered}

UpdateXML replaces a single fragment of XML with another fragment. It
requires specification of the XML fragment to be replaced and the XPath
expression to locate the required node.

*Change the title for the CD with identifier A2 1325 to Stonehenge*

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
UPDATE cdlib SET doc = UpdateXML(doc,'//cd[cdid="A2 1325"]/cdtitle', '<cdtitle>Stonehenge</cdtitle>');
```

You can repeat the previous query to find the title of the first CD to
verify the update.

### Generating XML {.unnumbered}

A set of user defined functions (UDF)[^xml-8] has been developed to convert
the results of an SQL query into XML. The xql_element function is used
to define the name and value of the XML element to be reported. Here is
an example.

[^xml-8]: The lib\\mysqludf\\xql library is housed at
    [http://www.mysqludf.org.](http://www.mysqludf.org).) It might not
    be installed for the version of MySQL you are using.

*List in XML format the name of all stocks with a PE ratio greater than
14.*

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT xql_element ('firm',shrfirm) FROM share WHERE shrpe > 14
```

*Query output*

```{XML, eval = FALSE}
<firm>Canadian Sugar</firm>
<firm>Freedonia Copper</firm>
<firm>Sri Lankan Gold</firm>
```

The preceding is just a brief example of what can be done. Read the
documentation on UDF to learn how to handle more elaborate
transformations.

### Conclusion {.unnumbered}

XML has two main roles. The first is to facilitate the exchange of data
between organizations and within those organizations that do not have
integrated systems. Its second purpose is to support exchange between
servers.

Mastery of XML is well beyond the scope of a single chapter. Indeed, it
is a book-length topic, and hundreds of books have been written on XML.
It is important to remember that the prime goal of XML is to support
data interchange. If you would like to continue learning about XML, then
consider the open content textbook (en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XML), which
was created by students and is under continual revision. You might want
to contribute to this book.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

Electronic data exchange became more important with the introduction of
the Internet. SGML, a precursor of XML, defines the structure of
documents. SGML's value derives from its reusability, flexibility,
support for revision, and format independence. XML, a derivative of
SGML, is designed to support electronic commerce and overcome some of
the shortcomings of SGML. XML supports data exchange by making
information self-describing. It is a metalanguage because it is a
language for generating other languages (e.g., finML). It provides
substantial gains for the management and distribution of data. The XML
language consists of an XML schema, document object model (DOM), and
XSL. A schema defines the structure of a document and how an application
should interpret XML markup tags. The DOM is a tree-based data model of
an XML document. XSL is used to specify a stylesheet for displaying an
XML document. XML documents can be stored in either a RDBMS or XML
database.

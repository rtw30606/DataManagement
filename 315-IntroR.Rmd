### Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

Students completing this chapter will:

-   Be able to use R for file handling and basic statistics;

-   Be competent in the use of RStudio.

## The R project {.unnumbered}

The [R project](http://www.r-project.org) supports ongoing
development of R, a free software environment for statistical computing,
data visualization, and data analytics. It is a highly-extensible
platform, the R programming language is object-oriented, and R runs on
the common operating systems. The adoption of R has grown in recent years, and is now the one of the most popular analytics platform.

[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) is a commonly used **integrated
development environment** (IDE) for R. It contains four windows. The
upper-left window contains scripts, one or more lines of R code that
constitute a task. Scripts can be saved and reused. It is good practice
to save scripts as you will find you can often edit an existing script
to meet the needs of a new task. The upper-right window provides details
of all datasets created. It also useful for importing datasets and
reviewing the history of R commands executed. The lower-left window
displays the results of executed scripts. If you want to clear this
window, then press control-L. The lower-right window can be used to show
files on your system, plots you have created by executing a script,
packages installed and loaded, and help information.

### Creating a project {.unnumbered}

It usually makes sense to store all R scripts and data for a project in the same
folder or directory. Thus, when you first start RStudio, create a new
project.

Project > Create Project...

RStudio remembers the state of each window, so when you quit and reopen,
it will restore the windows to their prior state. You can also open an
existing project, which sets the path to the folder for that project. As
a result, all saved scripts and files during a session are stored in
that folder.

### Scripting {.unnumbered}

A script is a set of R commands. You can also think of it as a short
program.

```{r, sample-script, eval = F}
# CO2 parts per million (ppm) for 2000-2009
co2 <- c(369.40,371.07,373.17,375.78,377.52,379.76,381.85,383.71,385.57,384.78)
year <-  (2000:2009) # a range of values
# show values
co2
year
# compute mean and standard deviation
mean(co2)
sd(co2)
plot(year,co2)
```

The previous script

-   Creates an object co2 with the values 369.40, 371.07, ... , 348.78.

-   Creates an object year with values 2000 through 2009.

-   Displays in the lower-left window the values stored in these two
    objects.

-   Computes the mean for each variable.

-   Creates an x-y plot of year and co2, which is shown in the
    lower-right window.

## Datasets {.unnumbered}

An R dataset is the familiar table of the relational model. There is one
row for each observation, and the columns contain the observed values or
facts about each observation. R supports multiple data structures and
data types.

### Vector {.unnumbered}

A vector is a single row table where data are all of the same type
(e.g., character, logical, numeric). In the following sample code, two
numeric vectors are created.

```{r, vector, eval = F}
co2 <-  c(369.40,371.07,373.17,375.78,377.52,379.76,381.85,383.71,385.57,384.78)
year <-  (2000:2009)
co2[2] # show the second value
```

### Matrix {.unnumbered}

A matrix is a table where all data are of the same type. Because it is a
table, a matrix has two dimensions, which need to be specified when
defining the matrix. The sample code creates a matrix with 4 rows and 3
columns, as the results of the executed code illustrate.

```{r, matrix, eval = F}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow=4,ncol=3)
m[4,3] # show the value in row 4, column 3
```

|        | [,1]   | [,2] | [,3] |
|--------|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| **[1,]** | 1      | 5      | 9      |
| **[2,]** | 2      | 6      | 10     |
| **[3,]** | 3      | 7      | 11     |
| **[4,]** | 4      | 8      | 12     |

>Create a matrix with 6 rows and 3 columns
> containing the numbers 1 through 18.

### Array {.unnumbered}

An array is a multidimensional table. It extends a matrix beyond two
dimensions. Review the results of running the following code by
displaying the array created.

```{r, array, eval = F}
a <-  array(letters[seq(1:24)], c(4,3,2))
a[1,1,1] # show the first value in the array
```

### Data frame {.unnumbered}

While vectors, matrices, and arrays are all forms of a table, they are
restricted to data of the same type (e.g., numeric). A data frame, like
a relational table, can have columns of different data types. The sample
code creates a data frame with character and numeric data types.

```{r, data-frame, eval = F}
gender <- c("m","f","f")
age <- c(5,8,3)
df <-  data.frame(gender,age)
# show some data frame values
df[1,2] # a cell
df[1,] # a row
df[,2] # a column
```

### List {.unnumbered}

The most general form of data storage is a list, which is an ordered
collection of objects. It permits you to store a variety of objects
together under a single name. In other words, a list is an object that
contains other objects. Retrieve a list member with a *single square
bracket* []. To reference a list member directly, use a *double square
bracket* [[]].

```{r, list, eval = F}
l <-  list(co2,m,df)
# show a list member
l[3] # retrieves list member
l[[3]] # reference a list member
l[[1]][2] # second element of list 1
```

### Logical operators {.unnumbered}

R supports the common logical operators, as shown in the following
table.

| Logical operator | Symbol |
|:-----------------|:-------|
| EQUAL            | ==    |
| AND              | &      |
| OR               | |     |
| NOT              | !      |

### Object {.unnumbered}

In R, an object is anything that can be assigned to a variable. It can
be a constant, a function, a data structure, a graph, a times series,
and so on. You find that the various packages in R support the creation
of a wide range of objects and provide functions to work with these and
other objects. A variable is a way of referring to an object. Thus, we
might use the variable named *l* to refer to the list object defined in
the preceding subsection.

### Types of data {.unnumbered}

R can handle the four types of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, and
ratio.

*Nominal* data, typically character strings, are used for
classification (e.g., high, medium, or low).

*Ordinal* data represent an
ordering and thus can be sorted (e.g., the seeding or ranking of players
for a tennis tournament). The intervals between ordinal data are not
necessarily equal. Thus, the top seeded tennis play (ranked 1) might be
far superior to the second seeded (ranked 2), who might be only
marginally better than the third seed (ranked 3).

*Interval* and *ratio* are
forms of measurement data. The interval between the units of measure for
interval data are equal. In other words, the distance between 50cm and
51cm is the same as the distance between 105cm and 106cm. Ratio data
have equal intervals and a natural zero point. Time, distance, and mass
are examples of ratio scales. Celsius and Fahrenheit are interval data
types, but not ratio, because the zero point is arbitrary. As a result,
10ºC is not twice as hot as 5ºC. Whereas, Kelvin is a ratio data type
because nothing can be colder than 0º K, a natural zero point.

In R, nominal and ordinal data types are also known as *factors*.
Defining a column as a factor determines how its data are analyzed and
presented. By default, factor levels for character vectors are created
in alphabetical order, which is often not what is desired. To be
precise, specify using the levels option.

```{r, factors, eval = F}
rating <-   c('high','medium','low')
rating <-  factor(rating, order=T, levels = c('high','medium','low'))
```

Thus, the preceding code will result in changing the default reporting
of factors from alphabetical order (i.e., high, low, and medium) to
listing them in the specified order (i.e., high, medium, and low).

### Missing values {.unnumbered}

Missing values in R are represented as NA, meaning not available.
Infeasible values, such as the result of dividing by zero, are indicated
by NaN, meaning not a number. Any arithmetic expression or function
operating on data containing missing values will return NA. Thus
`sum(c(1,NA,2))` will return NA.

To exclude missing values from calculations, use the option `na.rm = T`,
which specifies the removal of missing values prior to calculations.
Thus, `sum(c(1,NA,2),na.rm=T)` will return 3.

You can remove rows with missing data by using `na.omit()`, which will
delete those rows containing missing values.

```{r, missing-values, eval = F}
gender <- c("m","f","f","f")
age <- c(5,8,3,NA)
df <-  data.frame(gender,age)
df2 <-  na.omit(df)
```

## Packages {.unnumbered}

A major advantage of R is that the basic software can be easily extended
by installing additional packages, of which close to 20,000 exist. You
can consult the [R package directory](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) to help find a package that has the
functions you need. RStudio has an interface for finding and
installing packages. See the Packages tab on RStudio's lower-right
window.


Before running a script, you need to indicate which packages it needs,
beyond the default packages that are automatically loaded. The library
statement specifies that a package is required for execution. The
following example uses the measurements package to handle the conversion
of Fahrenheit to Celsius. The package's documentation provides details
of how to use its various conversion options.

```{r, load-package, eval = F}
library(measurements) # previously installed
# convert F to C
conv_unit(100,'F','C')
```

>Install the measurements package and run the
> preceding code.

## File handing {.unnumbered}

Files are the usual form of input for R scripts. Fortunately, R can
handle a wide variety of input formats, including text (e.g., CSV),
statistical package (e.g., SAS), and XML. A common approach is to use a
spreadsheet to prepare a data file, export it as CSV, and then read it
into R.

### Reading a file {.unnumbered}

Files can be read from the local computer on which R is installed or the
Internet, as the following sample code illustrates. We will use the
readr library for handling files, so you will need to install it before
running the following code.

```{r, read-file, eval = FALSE}
library(readr)
# read a local file (this will not work on your computer)
t <- read_delim("Documents/R/Data/centralparktemps.txt", delim=",")
```

You can also read a remote file using a URL.

```{r, read-remote, eval = F}
library(readr)
# read using a URL
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim = ',')
```

You must define the separator for data fields with the delim keyword
(e.g., for a tab use `delim = 't')`.

### Learning about a file {.unnumbered}

After reading a file, you might want to learn about its contents. First,
you can click on the file's name in the top-right window. This will open
the file in the top-left window. If it is a long file, only a portion,
such as the first 1000 rows, will be displayed. Second, you can execute
some R commands, as shown in the following code, to show the first few
and last few rows. You can also report the dimensions of the file, its
structure, and the type of object.

```{r, file-information, eval = F}
library(readr)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
head(t) #  first few rows
tail(t) #  last few rows
dim(t) # dimension
str(t) # structure of a dataset
class(t) #type of object
```

### Referencing columns {.unnumbered}

Columns within a table are referenced by using the format
tablename$columname. This is similar to the qualification method used
in SQL. The following code shows a few examples. It also illustrates how
to add a new column to an existing table.

```{r, columns, eval = F}
library(measurements)
library(readr)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
# qualify with table name to reference a column
mean(t$temperature)
max(t$year)
range(t$month)
# create a new column with the temperature in Celsius
t$Ctemp = round(conv_unit(t$temperature,'F','C'),1) # round to one decimal
```

### Recoding {.unnumbered}

Some analyses might be facilitated by the recoding of data. For
instance, you might want to split a continuous measure into two
categories. Imagine you decide to classify all temperatures greater than
or equal to 25ºC as 'hot' and the rest as 'other.' Here are the R
command to create a new column in table t called Category.

```{r, recoding, eval = F}
t$Category <- ifelse(t$Ctemp >= 30, 'Hot','Other')
```

### Deleting a column {.unnumbered}

You can delete a column by setting each of its values to NULL.

```{r, deleting, eval = F}
t$Category <-  NULL
```

### Reshaping a file {.unnumbered}

Data are not always in the shape that you want. For example, you might
have a spreadsheet that, for each year, lists the quarterly observations
(i.e., year and four quarterly values in one row). For analysis, you
typically need to have a row for each distinct observation (e.g., year,
quarter, value). *Gathering* converts a document from what is commonly
called *wide* to *narrow* format. It is akin to normalization in that
the new table has year and quarter as the identifier of each
observation.

Once the file has been read, you create appropriate column names for the
converted file using the colnames() function applied to the file t.
Thus, the input file has column names of Q1, Q2, etc, but it makes sense
for these to be integers in the new file in a new column called quarter.

The gather command specifies the file to be gathered, the column names
of the new file, and the columns of the input file to be gathered (i.e.,
the four quarters in columns 2 through 5). Note that you also need
convert the column quarter from character to integer.

*Reshaping a file with gathering and spreading*

![](Figures/Chapter%2015/gather-spread.png)

```{r, reshaping, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/gatherExample.csv'
t <- read_csv(url)
t
colnames(t) <- c('year',1:4)
t
# gather with data in columns 2 through 5
g <- gather(t,'quarter','value',2:5)
g$quarter <- as.integer(g$quarter)
g

# spread
s <- spread(g,quarter,value)
s
colnames(s) <- c('year', 'Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4')
s
# Spreading takes a narrow file and converts it to wide or spreadsheet format. This is the reverse of gathering.
s <- spread(g,quarter,value)
s
colnames(s) <- c('year', 'Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4')
s
```

### Writing a file {.unnumbered}

R can write data in a few file formats. We just focus on text format in
this brief introduction. The following code illustrates how to create a
new column containing the temperature in C and renaming an existing
column. The revised table is then written as a csv text file to the
project's folder.

```{r, writing, eval = F}
library(measurements)
library(readr)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
# compute Celsius and round to one decimal place
t$Ctemp = round(conv_unit(t$temperature,'F','C'),1)
colnames(t)[3] <-  'Ftemp' # rename third column to indicate Fahrenheit
write_csv(t,"centralparktempsCF.txt")
```

## Data manipulation with dplyr {.unnumbered}

The [dplyr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.htm) package provides functions for efficiently
manipulating data sets. By providing a series of basic data handling
functions and use of the pipe function ( %>% ),[^intror-4] dplyr
implements a grammar for data manipulation. The pipe function is used to
pass data from one operation to the next.


[^intror-4]: Short cut is Ctrl+Shift+M (Windows & Linux) or
    Cmd+Shift+M (Mac)

*Some dplyr functions*

| Function     | Purpose      |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------|
| filter()     | Select rows              |
| select()     | Select columns                         |
| arrange()    | Sort rows                          |
| summarize()  | Compute a single summary statistic       |
| group_by()   | Pair with summarize() to analyze groups within a dataset |
| inner_join() | Join two tables                |
| mutate()     | Create a new column           |

Here are some examples using dplyr with data frame t.

```{r, dplyr, eval = F}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
# a row subset
trow <-  filter(t, year == 1999)
# a column subset
tcol <-  select(t, year)
```

The following example illustrates application of the pipe function. The
data frame t is piped to select(), and the results of select method
passed onto filter(). The final output is stored in trowcol, which
contains year, month, and Celsius temperature for the years 1990 through
1999.

```{r, pipe, eval = F}
# a combo subset and use of the pipe function
trowcol <-  t %>%
  select(year, month, temperature) %>%
  filter(year > 1989 & year < 2000)
```

### Sorting {.unnumbered}

You can also use dplyr for sorting.

```{r, eorting, eval = F}
t <-  arrange(t, desc(year),month)
```

> -   Create a new text file using R
> -   Clean up the file for use with R and save it as CO2.txt
> -   Import (Import Dataset) the file into R
> -   Plot year versus CO~2~ emissions

### Summarizing data {.unnumbered}

The dplyr function can be used for summarizing data in a specified way
(e.g., mean, minimum, standard deviation). In the sample code, a file
containing the mean temperature for each year is created. Notice the use
of the pipe function to first group the data by year and then compute
the mean for each group.

```{r, summarizing, eval = F}
library(dplyr)
url <- 'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
w <-  t  %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(averageF = mean(temperature))
```

### Adding a column {.unnumbered}

The following example shows how to add a column and compute its average.

```{r, adding-column, eval = F}
# add column
t <-  mutate(t, CTemp = (temperature-32)*5/9)
# summarize
summarize(t, mean(CTemp))
```

> ❓ **Skill builder**
>
>Create a file with the maximum temperature for each
> year.

### Merging files {.unnumbered}

If there is a common column in two files, then they can be merged using
dplyr.::inner_join().[^intror-5] This is the same as joining two tables
using a primary key and foreign key match. In the following code, a file
is created with the mean temperature for each year, and it is merged
with CO~2~ readings for the same set of years.

[^intror-5]: This is the R notation for indicating the package (dplyr)
    to which a method (inner_join) belongs.

```{r, merging, eval = F}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
# average monthly temp for each year
a <-  t %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(temperature))
# read yearly carbon data (source: http://co2now.org/Current-CO2/CO2-Now/noaa-mauna-loa-co2-data.html)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/carbon1959-2011.txt'
carbon <- read_delim(url,  delim=',')
m <-  inner_join(a,carbon)
head(m)
```

### Data manipulation with sqldf {.unnumbered}

The sqldf package enables use of the broad power of SQL to extract rows
or columns from a data frame to meet the needs of a particular analysis.
It provides essentially the same data manipulation capabilities as
dplyr. The following example illustrates use of sqldf.

```{r, sqldf, eval = F}
library(sqldf)
library(readr)
options(sqldf.driver = "SQLite") # to avoid a conflict with RMySQL
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
# a row subset
trowcol <-  sqldf("select year, month, temperature from t where year > 1989 and year < 2000")
```

However, sqldf does not enable you to embed R functions within an SQL
command. For this reason, dplyr is the recommended approach for data
manipulation. However, there might be occasions when you find it more
efficient to first execute a complex query in SQL and then do further
analysis with dplyr.

### Correlation coefficient {.unnumbered}

A correlation coefficient is a measure of the covariation between two
sets of observations. In this case, we are interested in whether there
is a statistically significant covariation between temperature and the
level of atmospheric CO~2~.[^intror-6]

[^intror-6]: As I continually revise data files to include the latest
    observations, your answer might differ for this and other analyses.

The following example shows how to create reproducible analytics, whereby the results of the analysis are used to provide text for the report.

```{r, correlation-1, eval = F}
cor.test(m$mean, m$CO2)
```
The following results indicate that a correlation of .40 is a statistically significant as the p-value is less than 0.05, the common threshold for significance testing. Thus, we conclude that, because there is a small chance (p = .002997) of observing by chance such a value for the correlation coefficient, there is a relationship between mean temperature and the level of atmospheric CO2. Given that global warming theory predicts an increase in temperature with an increase in atmospheric CO2, we can also state that the observations support this theory. In other words, an increase in CO2 increases temperatures in Central Park.

```
Pearson's product-moment correlation
data:  m$mean and m$CO2
t = 3.1173, df = 51, p-value = 0.002997
95 percent confidence interval:
0.1454994 0.6049393
sample estimates:
    cor
0.4000598
```

When reporting correlation coefficients, you can you use the terms
small, moderate, and large in accordance with the values specified in
following table.

*Effect size table*

| Correlation coefficient | Effect size |
|:------------------------|:------------|
| .10 - .30               | Small       |
| .30 - .50               | Moderate    |
| > .50                  | Large       |

If we want to understand the nature of the relationship, we could fit a
linear model.

```{r, linear-model, eval = F}
mod <- lm(m$mean ~ m$CO2)
summary(mod)
```

The following results indicate a linear model is significant (p < .05),
and it explains 14.36% (adjusted multiple R-squared) of the variation
between temperature and atmospheric CO~2~. The linear equation is

$$temperature = 48.29 + 0.019208* CO2$$

As CO~2~ emissions are measured in parts per millions (ppm), an increase
of 1.0 ppm predicts an annual mean temperature increase in Central Park
of .01920 F°. Currently CO~2~ emissions are increasing at about 2.0 ppm
per year.

As a linear model explains about 14% of the variation, this suggests
that there might other variables that should be considered (e.g., level
of volcanic activity) and that the relationship might not be linear.

## Database access {.unnumbered}

The DBI package provides a convenient way for a direct connection
between R and a relational database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Once
the connection has been made, you can run an SQL query and load the
results into a R data frame.

The dbConnect() function makes the connection. You specify the type of
relational database, url, database name, userid, and password, as shown
in the following code.[^intror-7]

[^intror-7]: You will likely get a warning message of the form
    "unrecognized MySQL field type 7 in column 0 imported as character,"
    because R does does recognize the first column as a timestamp. You
    can ignore it, but later you might need to convert the column to R's
    timestamp format.

```{r, database, eval = F}
library(DBI)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="Weather", user="student", password="student")
# Query the database and create file t for use with R
t <- dbGetQuery(conn,"select * from record;")
head(t)
```

For security reasons, it is not a good idea to put database access
details in your R code. They should be hidden in a file. I recommend
that you create a csv file within your R code folder to containing
database access parameters. First, create a new directory or folder
(File > New Project > New Directory > Empty Project), called dbaccess
for containing you database access files. Then, create a csvfile (Use
File > New File > Text File) with the name weather_richardtwatson.csv
in the newly created folder containing the following data:

```
url,dbname,user,password:
richardtwatson.com,Weather,student,student
```

The R code will now be:

```{r, database-weather, eval = FALSE}
# Database access
library(readr)
library(DBI)
url <-  'dbaccess/weather_richardtwatson.csv'
d <-  read_csv(url)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), d$url, dbname=d$dbname, user=d$user, password=d$password)
t <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT timestamp, airTemp from record;")
head(t)
```

Despite the prior example, I will continue to show database access
parameters because you need them to run the sample code. However, in
practice you should follow the security advice given.

### Timestamps {.unnumbered}

Many data sets include a timestamp to indicate when an observation was
recorded. A timestamp will show the data and time to the second or
microsecond. The format of a standard timestamp is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
(e.g., 2010-01-31 03:05:46).

Some R functions, including those in the lubridate package, can detect a
standard format timestamp and support operations for extracting parts of
it, such as the year, month, day, hour, and so forth. The following
example shows how to use lubridate to extract the month and year from a
character string in standard timestamp format.

```{r, time-stamp, eval = FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(DBI)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="Weather", user="student", password="student")
# Query the database and create file t for use with R
t <- dbGetQuery(conn,"select * from record;")
t$year <- year(t$timestamp)
t$month <- month(t$timestamp)
head(t)
```

## Excel files {.unnumbered}

There are a number of packages with methods for reading an Excel file.
Of these, readxl seems to be the simplest. However, it can handle only
files stored locally, which is the case with most of the packages
examined. If the required Excel spreadsheet is stored remotely, then
download it and store it locally.

```{r, excel, eval = F}
library(readxl)
library(httr)
# read remote file and store on disk
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/GDP.xlsx'
GET(url,write_disk('temp.xlsx',overwrite = TRUE))
e <-  read_excel('temp.xlsx',sheet = 1,col_names = TRUE)
```

## R resources {.unnumbered}

The vast number of packages makes the learning of R a major challenge.
The basics can be mastered quite quickly, but you will soon find that
many problems require special features or the data need some
manipulation. Once you learn how to solve a particular problem, make
certain you save the script, with some embedded comments, so you can
reuse the code for a future problem. There are books that you might find
useful to have in electronic format on your computer or tablet, and one
of these is listed at the end of the chapter. There are, however, many
more [books](http://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html), both of a general and specialized nature. The
[R Reference Card](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf) is
handy to keep nearby when you are writing scripts. I printed and
laminated a copy, and it's in the top drawer of my desk. A useful
website is [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net), which is an
online reference for common tasks, such as those covered in this
chapter.


## R and data analytics {.unnumbered}

R is a platform for a wide variety of data analytics, including

-   Statistical analysis

-   Data visualization

-   HDFS and cluster computing

-   Text mining

-   Energy Informatics

-   Dashboards

You have probably already completed an introductory statistical analysis
course, and you can now use R for all your statistical needs. In
subsequent chapters, we will discuss data visualization, HDFS and
cluster computing, and text mining.

R is also a programming language. You might find that in some
situations, R provides a quick method for reshaping files and performing
calculations.

### Summary {.unnumbered}

R is a free software environment for statistical computing, data
visualization, and data analytics. RStudio is a commonly used integrated
development environment (IDE) for R. A script is a set of R commands.
Store all R scripts and data for a project in the same folder or
directory. An R dataset is a table that can be stored as a vector,
matrix, array, data frame, and list. In R, an object is anything that
can be assigned to a variable. R can handle the four types of data:
nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Nominal and ordinal data types
are also known as factors. Defining a column as a factor determines how
its data are analyzed and presented. Missing values are indicated by NA.
R can handle a wide variety of input formats, including text (e.g.,
CSV), statistical package (e.g., SAS), and XML. Data can be reshaped.
Gathering converts a document from what is commonly called wide to
narrow format. Spreading takes a narrow file and converts it to wide
format. Columns within a table are referenced using the format
tablename$columname. R can write data to a file. A major advantage of R
is that the basic software can be easily extended by installing
additional packages. The dplyr packages adds functionality for data
management and reporting. Learning R is a major challenge because of the
many packages available.

## Exercises {.unnumbered}

1.  Access a [car sales file](http://richardtwatson.com/data/manheim.txt)
    which contains details of the sales of three car models: X, Y,
    and Z.

    a.  Use the table function to compute the number of sales for each
        type of model.

    d.  Report the mean price for each type of sale.

2.  Use the 'Import Dataset' feature of RStudio to read
    [electricity data](http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/electricityprices.csv), which
    contains details of electricity prices for a major city.[^intror-10]
    [^intror-10]: Note these prices have been transformed from the original
        values, but are still representative of the changes over time.

    a.  What is the maximum cost?

    b.  What is the minimum cost?

    c.  What is the mean cost?

    d.  What is the median cost?

3.  Read the table containing [details of the wealth of various countries](http://richardtwatson.com/data/wealth.csv) and complete
    the following exercises.

    a.  Sort the table by GDP per capita.

    b.  What is the average GDP per capita?

    c.  Compute the ratio of US GDP per capita to the average GDP per
        capita.

    d.  What's the correlation between GDP per capita and wealth per
        capita?

4.  Merge the data for weather (database weather
    discussed in the chapter) and electricity prices (Use RStudio's
    'Import Dataset' to read [electricity data](http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/electricityprices.csv) and
    compute the correlation between temperature and electricity price.
    *Hint*: MySQL might return a timestamp with decimal seconds (e.g.,
    2010-01-01 01:00:00.0), and you can remove the rightmost two
    characters using [substr()](http://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html), so that the two timestamp
    columns are of the same format and length. Also, you need to ensure
    that the timestamps from the two data frames are of the same data
    type (e.g., both character).

5.  Get the list of [failed US banks](https://explore.data.gov/Banking-Finance-and-Insurance/FDIC-Failed-Bank-List/pwaj-zn2n).

    b.  How many banks were not acquired (hint: nrow() will count rows
        in a table)?

    c.  How many banks were closed each year (hint: use strptime() and
        the lubridate package)?

6.  Use Table01 reporting [U.S. broccoli data on farms and area harvested](http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1816).

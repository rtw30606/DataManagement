### Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

Students completing this chapter will:

-   Understand the principles of the grammar of graphics;

-   Be able to select data from a database for graphic creation;

-   Be able to depict locations on a Google map.

## Visual processing {.unnumbered}

Humans are particularly skilled at processing visual information because
it is an innate capability, compared to reading which is a learned
skill. When we evolved on the Savannah of Africa, we had to be adept at
processing visual information (e.g., recognizing danger) and deciding on
the right course of action (fight or flight). Our ancestors were those
who were efficient visual processors and quickly detected threats and
used this information to make effective decisions. They selected actions
that led to survival. Those who were inefficient visual information
processors did not survive to reproduce. Moreover, those with good visual
skills failed to propagate if they made poor decisions relative to
detected dangers. Consequently, we should seek opportunities to present
information visually and play to our evolved strength. As people vary in
their preference for visual and textual information, it often makes
sense to support both types of reporting.

In order to learn how to visualize data, you need to become familiar
with the grammar of graphics and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) (a popular R package for graphics).
In line with the learning of data modeling and SQL, we will take an
intertwined spiral approach. First we will tackle the grammar of
graphics (the abstract) and then move to ggplot2 (the concrete). You
will also learn how to take the output of an SQL query and feed it
directly into ggplot2. The end result will be a comprehensive set of
practical skills for data visualization.

## The grammar of graphics {.unnumbered}

A grammar is a system of rules for generating valid statements in a
language. A grammar makes it possible for people to communicate
accurately and concisely. English has a rather complex grammar, as do
most languages. In contrast, computer-related languages, such as SQL,
have a relatively simple grammar because they are carefully designed for
expressive power, consistency, and ease of use. Each of the dialects of
data modeling also has a grammar, and each of these  is quite
similar in that they all have the same foundational elements: entities,
attributes, identifiers, and relationships.

A grammar was designed by Wilkinson[^dataviz-1] for creating
graphics to enhance their expressiveness and comprehensiveness. From a
mathematical perspective, a graph is a set of points. A graphic is a
physical representation of a graph. Thus, a graph can have many physical
representations, and one of the skills you need to gain is to be able to
judge what is a meaningful graphic for your clients. A grammar for
graphics provides you with many ways of creating a graphic, just as the
grammar of English gives you many ways of writing a sentence. Of course,
we differ in our ability to convey information in English. Similarly, we
also differ in our skills in representing a graph in a visual format.
The aesthetic attributes of a graph determine its ability to convey
information. For a graphic, aesthetics are specified by elements such as
size and color. One of the most applauded graphics is Minard's drawing
in 1861 of Napoleon's advance on and retreat from Russia during 1812.
The dominating aspect of the graphic is the dwindling size of the French
army as it battled winter, disease, and the Russian army. The graph
shows the size of the army, its location, and the direction of its
movement. The temperature during the retreat is drawn at the bottom of
graphic.

[^dataviz-1]: Wilkinson, L. (2005). *The grammar of graphics* (2nd
    ed.). New York: Springer.

*Charles Joseph Minard's graphic of Napoleon's Russian expedition in
1812*

![](Figures/Chapter%2016/Charles-Joseph-Minard.png)

Wilkinson's grammar is based on six elements:

1.  *Data*: a set of data operations that creates variables from
    datasets;

2.  *Trans*: variable transformations;

3.  *Scale*: scale transformations;

4.  *Coord*: a coordinate system;

5.  *Element*: a graph and its aesthetic attributes;

6.  *Guide*: one or more guides.

Interest in the grammar of data visualization has increased in recent
years because of the growth in data. There is ongoing search to find
ways to reveal clearly the information in large data sets.
[Vega](http://trifacta.github.io/vega/) is a recent formulation building on Wilkinson's work.
In Vega, a visualization consists of basic properties of a graph (such
as the width and height) and definitions of the data to visualize,
scales for mapping to data to a visual form, axes for representing
scales, and graphic marks (such as rectangles, circles, and arcs) for
displaying the data.


## ggplot2 {.unnumbered}

ggplot2 is an implementation of Vega in R. Because it is based on a
grammar, ggplot2 is a very powerful graphics tool for creating both
simple and complex graphs. It is well-suited for generating
multi-layered graphs because of its grammatical foundation. As a result,
using ggplot2 you specify a series of steps (think of them as sentences)
to create a graphic (think of it as a paragraph) to visually convey your
message.

### Data {.unnumbered}

Most structured data, which is what we require for graphing, are
typically stored in spreadsheets or databases. In the prior chapter, you learned how to read a spreadsheet exported as a CSV
file and access a database. These are also the skills you need for
reading a file containing data to be visualized.

### Transformation {.unnumbered}

A transformation converts data into a format suitable for the intended
visualization. In this case, we want to depict the relative change in
carbon levels since pre-industrial periods, when the value was 280 ppm.
Here are sample R commands.

```{r transform-1, eval = F}
# compute a new column in carbon containing the relative change in CO2
carbon$relCO2 = (carbon$CO2-280)/280
```

There are many ways that you might want to transform data. The preceding
example just illustrates the general nature of a transformation. You can
also think of SQL as a transformation process as it can compute new
values from existing columns.

### Coord {.unnumbered}

A coordinate system describes where things are located. A geopositioning
system (GPS) reading of latitude and longitude describes where you are
on the surface of the globe. It is typically layered onto a map so you
can see where you are relative to your current location. Most graphs are
plotted on a two-dimensional (2D) grid with x (horizontal) and y
(vertical) coordinates. ggplot2 currently supports six 2D coordinate
systems, as shown in the following table. The default coordinate system
for most packages is Cartesian.

*Coordinate systems*

| Name      | Description                       |
|:----------|:----------------------------------|
| cartesian | Cartesian coordinates             |
| equal     | Equal scale Cartesian coordinates |
| flip      | Flipped Cartesian coordinates     |
| trans     | Transformed Cartesian coordinates |
| map       | Map projections                   |
| polar     | Polar coordinates                 |

### Element {.unnumbered}

An element is a graph and its attributes. Let's start with a simple
scatterplot of year against CO~2~ emissions. We do this in two steps
applying the ggplot2 approach of building a graphic by adding layers.

```{r element, message = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- 'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/carbon.txt'
carbon <- read_delim(url, delim = ',')
# Select year(x) and CO2(y) to create a x-y point plot
# Specify red points, as you find that aesthetically pleasing
ggplot(carbon,aes(year,CO2)) +
  geom_point(color='red')
# Add some axes labels
# Notice how ‘+’ is used for commands that extend over one line
ggplot(carbon,aes(year,CO2)) +
  geom_point(color='red') +
  xlab('Year') +
  ylab('CO2 ppm of the atmosphere')
```

Graphics appear under the Plots tab of the bottom right window of RStudio. You can
select the Export tab to save a graphic to a file or the clipboard.
Also, notice that you can use left and right arrows of the Plots tab to
cycle through graphics created in a session.

### Zero point {.unnumbered}

It is usually a good idea to have a zero point for the y axis so you
don't distort the slope of the line. In the following example, ylim()
sets the range for y. Notice the use of max() to automatically set an upper limit for y based on its values.

```{r zero, message = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
url <- 'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/carbon.txt'
carbon <- read_delim(url, delim = ',')
# compute a new column in carbon containing the relative change in CO2
carbon$relCO2 = (carbon$CO2-280)/280
ggplot(carbon,aes(year,relCO2)) +
  geom_line(color='salmon') +
  xlab('Year') +
  ylab('Relative change of atmospheric CO2') +
  ylim(0,max(carbon$relCO2))
```

### Axes and legends {.unnumbered}

Axes and legends are both forms of guides, which help the reader to
understand a graphic. Readability enhancers such as axes, title, and
tick marks are generated automatically based on the parameters specified
in the ggplot2 command. You can override the defaults.

Let's redo the graphic with the relative change since the beginning of
industrialization in the mid 18th century, when the level of CO2 was
around 280 ppm. This time, we will create a line plot. We also add some
titles for the axes and specify a format of four consecutive digits for
displaying a year on the x-axis. We also move or offset the title for
the y-axis a bit to the left to improve readability.

```{r transform-2, message = TRUE}
# compute a new column containing the relative change in CO2
# compute a new column in carbon containing the relative change in CO2
carbon$relCO2 = (carbon$CO2-280)/280
ggplot(carbon,aes(year,relCO2)) + geom_line(color='salmon') +
xlab('Year') + ylab('Relative change of atmospheric CO2') + ylim(0,.5)
```

As the prior graphic shows, the present level of CO~2~ in the atmosphere
is now above 40 percent higher than the pre-industrial period and is
continuing to grow.

### Guides {.unnumbered}

Axes and legends are both forms of guides, which help the reader to
understand a graphic. In ggplot2, legends and axes are generated
automatically based on the parameters specified in the ggplot2 command.
You have the capability to override the defaults for axes, but the
legend is quite fixed in its format.

In the following graphic, for each axis there is a label and there are
tick marks with values so that you eyeball a point on the graphic for
its x and y values. The legend enables you to determine which color, in
this case, matches each year. A legend could also use shape (e.g., a
diamond) and shape size to aid matching.

## Some recipes {.unnumbered}

Learning the full power of ggplot2 is quite an undertaking, so here are
a few recipes for visualizing data.

### Histogram {.unnumbered}

Histograms are useful for showing the distribution of values in a single
column. A histogram has a vertical orientation. The number of
occurrences of a particular value in a column are automatically counted
by the ggplot2 function. In the following sample code, we show the
distribution of temperatures in Celsius for the Central Park temperature
data. Notice that the Celsius conversion is rounded to an integer for
plotting. Width specifies the size of the bin, which is two in this
case. This means that the bin above the tick mark 10 contains all values
in the range 9 to 11. There is [a range of named colors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp)  you can
use in ggplot2.

```{r histogram, message = TRUE}
library(measurements)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
t$C <- conv_unit(t$temperature,'F','C')
ggplot(t,aes(C)) +
  geom_histogram(fill='skyblue') +
  xlab('Celsius')
```

### Bar graph {.unnumbered}

In the following example, we query a database to get data for plotting.
Because the column selected for graphing, productLine is categorical, we
need to use a bar graph.

```{r bargraph, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 'www.richardtwatson.com', dbname = 'ClassicModels', user = 'student', password = 'student')
# Query the database and create file for use with R
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,'SELECT * from Products;')
# Plot the number of product lines
ggplot(d,aes(x=productLine)) +
  geom_bar(fill = 'chocolate')
```

### Column graph {.unnumbered}

In the following example, we query a database to get data for plotting/
We then count the number of products in each productLine, and as we have
counts a column graph is specified.

```{r columngraph, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 'www.richardtwatson.com', dbname = 'ClassicModels', user = 'student', password = 'student')
# Query the database and create file for use with R
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,'SELECT * from Products;')
da <-  d %>%
  group_by(productLine) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
ggplot(da,aes(productLine,count)) +
  geom_col(fill='chocolate')
```

Because ggplot2 is based on a grammar of graphics, with a few changes,
you can create a bar graph of the same data.

```{r barchart, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 'www.richardtwatson.com', dbname = 'ClassicModels', user = 'student', password = 'student')
# Query the database and create file for use with R
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,'SELECT * from Products;')
da <-  d %>%
  group_by(productLine) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
ggplot(d,aes(productLine)) +
  geom_bar(fill='gold') +
  coord_flip()
```

> | population (billions) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8  | 9    |

### Scatterplot {.unnumbered}

A scatterplot shows points on an x-y grid, which means you need to have
a pair of numeric values.

```{r scatterplot-1, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 'www.richardtwatson.com', dbname = 'ClassicModels', user = 'student', password = 'student')
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT MONTH(orderDate) AS orderMonth, sum(quantityOrdered*priceEach) AS orderValue FROM Orders JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.orderNumber = OrderDetails.orderNumber GROUP BY orderMonth;")
# Plot data orders by month
# Show the points and the line
ggplot(d,aes(x=orderMonth,y=orderValue)) +
  geom_point(color='red') +
  geom_line(color='blue')

```

It is sometimes helpful to show multiple scatterplots on the one grid.
In ggplot, you can create groups of points for plotting. Sometimes, you
might find it convenient to recode data so you can use different colors
or lines to distinguish values in set categories. Let's examine grouping
by year.

```{r scatterplot-2, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
library(scales)
# Get the value of orders by year and month
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 'www.richardtwatson.com', dbname = 'ClassicModels', user = 'student', password = 'student')
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT YEAR(orderDate) AS orderYear, MONTH(orderDate) AS Month, sum((quantityOrdered*priceEach)) AS Value FROM Orders, OrderDetails WHERE Orders.orderNumber = OrderDetails.orderNumber GROUP BY orderYear, Month;")
# Plot data orders by month and grouped by year
# ggplot expects grouping variables to be character, so convert
# load scales package for formatting as dollars
d$Year <- as.character(d$orderYear)
  ggplot(d,aes(x=Month,y=Value,group=Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=Year)) +
# Format as dollars
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar)
```

Sometimes the data that you want to graph will be in multiple files.
Here is a case where we want to show ClassicCars' orders and payments by
month on the same plot.

```{r scatterplot-3, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
library(scales)
# Load the driver
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
orders <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT MONTH(orderDate) AS month, sum((quantityOrdered*priceEach)) AS orderValue FROM Orders, OrderDetails WHERE Orders.orderNumber = OrderDetails.orderNumber and YEAR(orderDate) = 2004 GROUP BY Month;")
payments <-  dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT MONTH(paymentDate) AS month, SUM(amount) AS payValue FROM Payments WHERE YEAR(paymentDate) = 2004 GROUP BY MONTH;")
ggplot(orders,aes(x=month)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=orders$orderValue, color='Orders')) +
  geom_line(aes(y=payments$payValue, color='Payments')) +
  xlab('Month') + ylab('') +
  # Format as dollars and show each month
  scale_y_continuous(label = dollar)  + scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:12)) +
  # Remove the legend
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())

```

### Smoothing {.unnumbered}

Smoothing helps to detect a trend in a line plot. The following example
shows the average mean temperatures for August for Central Park.

```{r smoothing, message = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
url <-  'http://www.richardtwatson.com/data/centralparktemps.txt'
t <- read_delim(url, delim=',')
# select the August data
ta <-  t %>% filter(month == 8)
ggplot(ta,aes(year,temperature)) +
  geom_line(color="red") +
  geom_smooth()
```

> layer_model_predictions(). What do you observe?

### Box Plot {.unnumbered}

A box plot is an effective means of displaying information about one or
more variables. It shows minimum and maximum, range, lower quartile,
median, and upper quartile for each variable. The following code creates
a box plot for a single variable. Notice that we use factor(0) to
indicate there is no grouping variable.

```{r boxplot, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), "www.richardtwatson.com", dbname="ClassicModels", user="student", password="student")
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT * from Payments;")
# Boxplot of amounts paid
ggplot(d,aes(factor(0),amount)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour='red') +
   xlab("") +
   ylab("Check")

```

### Heat map {.unnumbered}

A heat map visualizes tabular data. It is useful when you have two
categorical variables cross tabulated. Consider the case for the
ClassicModels database where we want to get an idea of the different
number of model scales in each product line. We can get a quick picture
with the following code.

```{r heatmap, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,'SELECT * from Products;')
da <- d %>% group_by(productLine, productScale) %>%
 summarize(count = n())
ggplot(da,aes(productLine,productScale)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill=count)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = 'light blue', high = 'dark blue') +
  xlab('Line') +
  ylab('Scale')
```

## Geographic data {.unnumbered}

The ggmap package supports a variety of mapping systems, including
Google maps. As you might expect, it offers many features, and we just
touch on the basics in this example.

The Offices table in the ClassicModels database includes the latitude
and longitude of each office in officeLocation, which has a datatype of
POINT. The following R code can be used to mark each office on a Google
map. After loading the required packages, a database query is executed
to return the longitude and latitude for each office. Then, a Google map
of the United States is displayed. The marker parameter specifies the
name of the table containing the values for longitude and latitude.
Offices that are not in the U.S. (e.g., Sydney) are ignored. Adjust
zoom, an integer, to get a suitably sized map. Zoom can range from 3 (a
continent) to 20 (a building).

You will need to a [GoogleAPIkey](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to run this application on your computer.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Google maps requires an [API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(mapproj)
library(DBI)
library(RMySQL)
conn <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 'www.richardtwatson.com', dbname = 'ClassicModels', user = 'student', password = 'student')
# Google maps requires lon and lat, in that order, to create markers
d <- dbGetQuery(conn,"SELECT ST_Y(officeLocation) AS lon, ST_X(officeLocation) AS lat FROM Offices;")
t <- read_csv("GoogleAPIkey.txt")
register_google(key = t$key)
# show offices in the United States
# vary zoom to change the size of the map
map <-  get_googlemap('united states',marker=d,zoom=4)
ggmap(map) +
  labs(x = 'Longitude', y = 'Latitude') +
  ggtitle('US offices')
```

## R resources {.unnumbered}

The developer of ggplot2, Hadley Wickham, maintains a [web
site](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). Another useful web site for
data visualization is [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com),
which has an associated book, titled *Visualize This*. If you become
heavily involved in visualization, we suggest you read some of the works
of Edward Tufte. One of his books is listed in the references.

### Summary {.unnumbered}

Because of evolutionary pressure, humans became strong visual
processors. Consequently, graphics can be very effective for presenting
information. The grammar of graphics provides a logical foundation for
the construction of a graphic by adding successive layers of
information. ggplot2 is a package implementing the grammar of graphics
in R, the open source statistics platform. Data can be extracted from an
MySQL database for processing and graphical presentation in R. Spatial
data can be selected from a database and displayed on a Google map.

    millions of dead weight tons (dwt)[^dataviz-4] for the given years,
    graph the relationship as a point plot. Add a linear prediction
    model to the graph. What is the approximate increase in the world
    capacity each year?

[^dataviz-4]: Dead weight tonnage is a measure of how much weight, in
    tonnes, a ship can safely carry.

<h2>Introduction<a href="data-integrity.html#introduction-2" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The management of data is driven by two goals: availability and
integrity. <strong>Availability</strong> deals with making data available to whomever
needs it, whenever and wherever he or she needs it, and in a meaningful
form. As illustrated in following figure, availability concerns the
creation, interrogation, and update of data stores. Although most of the
book, thus far, has dealt with making data available, a database is of
little use to anyone unless it has integrity. Maintaining data integrity
implies three goals:<a href="data-administration.html#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Protecting existence: Data are available when needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining quality: Data are accurate, complete, and current.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring confidentiality: Data are accessed only by those authorized
to do so.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Goals of managing organizational memory</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2023/goals.png" /></p>
<p>This chapter considers the three types of strategies for maintaining
data integrity:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Legal</strong> strategies are externally imposed laws, rules, and
regulations. Privacy laws are an example.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Administrative</strong> strategies are organizational policies and
procedures. An example is a standard operating procedure of storing
all backup files in a locked vault.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technical</strong> strategies are those incorporated in the computer
system (e.g., database management system, application
program, or operating system). An example is the inclusion of
validation rules (e.g., NOT NULL) in a database definition that are
used to ensure data quality when a database is updated.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong>consistent database</strong> is one in which all data integrity constraints
are satisfied.</p>
<p>Our focus is on data stored in multiuser computer databases and
technical and administrative strategies for maintaining integrity in
computer system environments., commonly referred to as <strong>database
integrity</strong>. More and more, organizational memories are being captured
in computerized databases. From an integrity perspective, this is a very
positive development. Computers offer some excellent mechanisms for
controlling data integrity, but this does not eliminate the need for
administrative strategies. Both administrative and technical strategies
are still needed.</p>
<p>Who is responsible for database integrity? Some would say the data
owners, others the database administrator. Both groups are right;
database integrity is a shared responsibility, and the way it is managed
may differ across organizations. Our focus is on the tools and
strategies for maintaining data integrity, regardless of who is
responsible.</p>
<p>The strategies for achieving the three integrity outcomes are summarized
in the following table. We will cover procedures for protecting
existence, followed by those for maintaining integrity, and finally
those used to ensure confidentiality. Before considering each of these
goals, we need to examine the general issue of transaction management.</p>

<div id="transaction-management" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Transaction management<a href="data-integrity.html#transaction-management" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Transaction management focuses on ensuring that transactions are
correctly recorded in the database. The <strong>transaction manager</strong> is the
element of a DBMS that processes transactions. A <strong>transaction</strong> is a
series of actions to be taken on the database such that they must be
entirely completed or entirely aborted. A transaction is a <strong>logical
unit of work</strong>. All its elements must be processed; otherwise, the
database will be incorrect. For example, with a sale of a product, the
transaction consists of at least two parts: an update to the inventory
on hand, and an update to the customer information for the items sold in
order to bill the customer later. Updating only the inventory or only
the customer information would create a database without integrity and
an inconsistent database.</p>
<p>Transaction managers are designed to accomplish the <strong>ACID</strong> (atomicity,
consistency, isolation, and durability) concept. These attributes are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Atomicity:</strong> If a transaction has two or more discrete pieces of
information, either all of the pieces are committed or none are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Either a transaction creates a valid new database
state or, if any failure occurs, the transaction manager returns the
database to its prior state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolation:</strong> A transaction in process and not yet committed must
remain isolated from any other transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Durability:</strong> Committed data are saved by the DBMS so that, in the
event of a failure and system recovery, these data are available in
their correct state.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Transaction atomicity requires that all transactions are processed on an
<strong>all-or-nothing</strong> basis and that any collection of transactions is
<strong>serializable</strong>. When a transaction is executed, either all its changes
to the database are completed or none of the changes are performed. In
other words, the entire unit of work must be completed. If a transaction
is terminated before it is completed, the transaction manager must undo
the executed actions to restore the database to its state before the
transaction commenced (the consistency concept). Once a transaction is
successfully completed, it does not need to be undone. For efficiency
reasons, transactions should be no larger than necessary to ensure the
integrity of the database. For example, in an accounting system, a debit
and credit would be an appropriate transaction, because this is the
minimum amount of work needed to keep the books in balance.</p>
<p><strong>Serializability</strong> relates to the execution of a set of transactions. An
interleaved execution schedule (i.e., the elements of different
transactions are intermixed) is serializable if its outcome is
equivalent to a non-interleaved (i.e., serial) schedule. Interleaved
operations are often used to increase the efficiency of computing
resources, so it is not unusual for the components of multiple
transactions to be interleaved. Interleaved transactions cause problems
when they interfere with each other and, as a result, compromise the
correctness of the database.</p>
<p>The ACID concept is critical to concurrent update control and recovery
after a transaction failure.</p>
<div id="concurrent-update-control" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Concurrent update control<a href="data-integrity.html#concurrent-update-control" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>When updating a database, most applications implicitly assume that their
actions do not interfere with any other’s actions. If the DBMS is a
single-user system, then a lack of interference is guaranteed. Most
DBMSs, however, are multiuser systems, where many analysts and
applications can be accessing a given database at the same time. When
two or more transactions are allowed to update a database concurrently,
the integrity of the database is threatened. For example, multiple
agents selling airline tickets should not be able to sell the same seat
twice. Similarly, inconsistent results can be obtained by a retrieval
transaction when retrievals are being made simultaneously with updates.
This gives the appearance of a loss of database integrity. We will first
discuss the integrity problems caused by concurrent updates and then
show how to control them to ensure database quality.</p>
<div id="lost-update" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Lost update<a href="data-integrity.html#lost-update" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Uncontrolled concurrent updates can result in the lost-update or
phantom-record problem. To illustrate the lost-update problem, suppose
two concurrent update transactions simultaneously want to update the
same record in an inventory file. Both want to update the
quantity-on-hand field (quantity). Assume quantity has a current value
of 40. One update transaction wants to add 80 units (a delivery) to
quantity, while the other transaction wants to subtract 20 units (a
sale).</p>
<p>Suppose the transactions have concurrent access to the record; that is,
each transaction is able to read the record from the database before a
previous transaction has been committed. This sequence is depicted in
the following figure. Note that the first transaction, A, has not
updated the database when the second transaction, B, reads the same
record. Thus, both A and B read in a value of 40 for quantity. Both make
their calculations, then A writes the value of 120 to disk, followed by
B promptly overwriting the 120 with 20. The result is that the delivery
of 80 units, transaction A, is lost during the update process.</p>

<p>Inconsistent retrievals occur when a transaction calculates some
aggregate function (e.g., sum) over a set of data while other
transactions are updating the same data. The problem is that the
retrieval may read some data before they are changed and other data
after they are changed, thereby yielding inconsistent results.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-solution-locking" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>The solution: locking<a href="data-integrity.html#the-solution-locking" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>To prevent lost updates and inconsistent retrieval results, the DBMS
must incorporate a resource <strong>lock</strong>, a basic tool of transaction
management to ensure correct transaction behavior. Any data retrieved by
one application with the intent of updating must be locked out or denied
access by other applications until the update is completed (or aborted).</p>
<p>There are two types of locks: <strong>Slocks</strong> (shared or read locks) and
<strong>Xlocks</strong> (exclusive or write locks). Here are some key points to
understand about these types of locks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When a transaction has a Slock on a database item, other
transactions can issue Slocks on the same item, but there can be no
Xlocks on that item.</p></li>
<li><p>Before a transaction can read a database item, it must be granted a
Slock or Xlock on that item.</p></li>
<li><p>When a transaction has an Xlock on a database item, no other
transaction can issue either a Slock or Xlock on that item.</p></li>
<li><p>Before a transaction can write to a database item, it must be
granted an Xlock on that item.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Consider the example used previously. When A accesses the record for
update, the DBMS must refuse all further accesses to that record until
transaction A is complete (i.e., an Xlock). As the following figure
shows, B’s first attempt to access the record is denied until
transaction A is finished. As a result, database integrity is
maintained. Unless the DBMS controls concurrent access, a multiuser
database environment can create both data and retrieval integrity
problems.</p>

<p>To administer locking procedures, a DBMS requires two pieces of
information:
1. Whether a particular transaction will update the database;
2. Where the transaction begins and ends.</p>
<p>Usually, the data required by an update transaction are locked when the
transaction begins and then released when the transaction is completed
(i.e., committed to the database) or aborted. Locking mechanisms can
operate at different levels of <strong>locking granularity</strong>: database, table,
page, row, or data element. At the most precise level, a DBMS can lock
individual data elements so that different update transactions can
update different items in the same record concurrently. This approach
increases processing overhead but provides the fewest resource
conflicts. At the other end of the continuum, the DBMS can lock the
entire database for each update. If there were many update transactions
to process, this would be very unacceptable because of the long waiting
times. Locking at the record level is the most common approach taken by
DBMSs.</p>
<p>In most situations, applications are not concerned with locking, because
it is handled entirely by the DBMS. But in some DBMSs, choices are
provided to the programmer. These are primarily limited to programming
language interfaces.</p>
<p>Resource locking solves some data and retrieval integrity problems, but
it may lead to another problem, referred to as <strong>deadlock</strong> or the
<strong>deadly embrace</strong>. Deadlock is an impasse that occurs because two
applications lock certain resources, then request resources locked by
each other. The following figure illustrates a deadlock situation. Both
transactions require records 1 and 2. Transaction A first accesses
record 1 and locks it. Then transaction B accesses record 2 and locks
it. Next, B’s attempt to access record 1 is denied, so the application
waits for the record to be released. Finally, A’s attempt to access
record 2 is denied, so the application waits for the record to be
released. Thus, application A’s update transaction is waiting for record
2 (locked by application B), and application B is waiting for record 1
(locked by application A). Unless the DBMS intervenes, both applications
will wait indefinitely.</p>
<p>There are two ways to resolve deadlock: prevention and resolution.
<strong>Deadlock prevention</strong> requires applications to lock in advance all
records they will require. Application B would have to lock both records
1 and 2 before processing the transaction. If these records are locked,
B would have to wait.</p>
<p><em>An example of deadlock</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2023/deadlock.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>two-phase locking protocol</strong> is a simple approach to preventing
deadlocks. It operates on the notion that a transaction has a growing
phase followed by a shrinking phase. During the growing phase, locks can
be requested. The shrinking phase is initiated by a release statement,
which means no additional locks can be requested. A release statement
enables the program to signal to the DBMS the transition from requesting
locks to releasing locks.</p>
<p>Another approach to deadlock prevention is <strong>deadlock resolution,</strong>
whereby the DBMS detects and breaks deadlocks. The DBMS usually keeps a
resource usage matrix, which instantly reflects which applications
(e.g., update transactions) are using which resources (e.g., rows). By
scanning the matrix, the DBMS can detect deadlocks as they occur. The
DBMS then resolves the deadlock by backing out one of the deadlocked
transactions. For example, the DBMS might release application A’s lock
on record 1, thus allowing application B to proceed. Any changes made by
application A up to that time (e.g., updates to record 1) would be
rolled back. Application A’s transaction would be restarted when the
required resources became available.</p>

<h3>Transaction failure and recovery<a href="data-integrity.html#transaction-failure-and-recovery" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>When a transaction fails, there is the danger of an inconsistent
database. Transactions can fail for a variety of reasons, including</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Program error (e.g., a logic error in the code)</p></li>
<li><p>Action by the transaction manager (e.g., resolution of a deadlock)</p></li>
<li><p>Self-abort (e.g., an error in the transaction data means it cannot
be completed)</p></li>
<li><p>System failure (e.g., an operating-system bug)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If a transaction fails for any reason, then the DBMS must be able to
restore the database to a correct state. To do this, two statements are
required: an <strong>end of transaction (EOT)</strong> and <strong>commit</strong>. EOT indicates
the physical end of the transaction, the last statement. Commit, an
explicit statement, must occur in the transaction code before the EOT
statement. The only statements that should occur between commit and EOT
are database writes and lock releases.</p>
<p>When a transaction issues a commit, the transaction manager checks that
all the necessary write-record locks for statements following the commit
have been established. If these locks are not in place, the transaction
is terminated; otherwise, the transaction is committed, and it proceeds
to execute the database writes and release locks. Once a transaction is
committed, a system problem is the only failure to which it is
susceptible.</p>
<p>When a transaction fails, the transaction manager must take one of two
corrective actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the transaction has not been committed, the transaction manager
must return the database to its state prior to the transaction. That
is, it must perform a <strong>rollback</strong> of the database to its most
recent valid state.</p></li>
<li><p>If the transaction has been committed, the transaction manager must
ensure that the database is established at the correct
post-transaction state. It must check that all write statements
executed by the transaction and those appearing between commit and
EOT have been applied. The DBMS may have to redo some writes.</p></li>

<h2>Protecting existence<a href="data-integrity.html#protecting-existence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>One of the three database integrity outcomes is protecting the existence
of the database—ensuring data are available when needed. Two
strategies for protecting existence are isolation and database backup
and recovery. <strong>Isolation</strong> is a preventive strategy that involves
administrative procedures to insulate the physical database from
destruction. Some mechanisms for doing this are keeping data in safe
places, such as in vaults or underground; having multiple installations;
or having security systems. For example, one organization keeps backup
copies of important databases on removable magnetic disks. These are
stored in a vault that is always guarded. To gain access to the vault,
employees need a badge with an encoded personal voice print. Many
companies have total-backup computer centers, which contain duplicate
databases and documentation for system operation. If something should
happen at the main center (e.g., a flood), they can be up and running at
their backup center in a few hours, or even minutes in some highly
critical situations. What isolation strategies do you use to protect the
backup medium of your personal computer? Do you make backup files?</p>

<h3>Backup and recovery<a href="data-integrity.html#backup-and-recovery" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Database backup and recovery is a curative strategy to protect the
existence of a physical database and to recreate or recover the data
whenever loss or destruction occurs. The possibility of loss always
exists. The use of, and choice among, backup and recovery procedures
depends upon an assessment of the risk of loss and the cost of applying
recovery procedures. The procedures in this case are carried out by the
computer system, usually the DBMS. Data loss and damage should be
anticipated. No matter how small the probability of such events, there
should be a detailed plan for data recovery.</p>
<p>There are several possible causes for data loss or damage, which can be
grouped into three categories.</p>
<div id="storage-medium-destruction" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Storage-medium destruction<a href="data-integrity.html#storage-medium-destruction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>In this situation, a portion or all of the database is unreadable as a
result of catastrophes such as power or air-conditioning failure, fire,
flood, theft, sabotage, and the overwriting of disks or tapes by
mistake. A more frequent cause is a disk failure. Some of the disk
blocks may be unreadable as a consequence of a read or write
malfunction, such as a head crash.</p>
</div>
<div id="abnormal-termination-of-an-update-transaction" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Abnormal termination of an update transaction<a href="data-integrity.html#abnormal-termination-of-an-update-transaction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>In this case, a transaction fails part way through execution, leaving
the database partially updated. The database will be inconsistent
because it does not accurately reflect the current state of the
business. The primary causes of an abnormal termination are a
transaction error or system failure. Some operation within transaction
processing, such as division by zero, may cause it to fail. A hardware
or software failure will usually result in one or more active programs
being aborted. If these programs were updating the database, integrity
problems could result.</p>
</div>
<div id="incorrect-data-discovered" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Incorrect data discovered<a href="data-integrity.html#incorrect-data-discovered" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>In this situation, an update program or transaction incorrectly updated
the database. This usually happens because a logic error was not
detected during program testing.</p>
<p>Because most organizations rely heavily on their databases, a DBMS must
provide the following three mechanisms for restoring a database quickly
and accurately after loss or damage:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Backup facilities</strong>, which create duplicate copies of the database</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Journaling facilities</strong>, which provide backup copies or an audit
trail of transactions or database changes</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>recovery facility</strong> within the DBMS that restores the database
to a consistent state and restarts the processing of transactions</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before discussing each of these mechanisms in more depth, let us review
the steps involved in updating a database and how backup and journaling
facilities might be integrated into this process.</p>
<p>An overview of the database update process is captured in the following
figure. The process can be viewed as a series of database state changes.
The initial database, state 1, is modified by an update transaction,
such as deleting customer Jones, creating a new state (state 2). State 1
reflects the state of the organization with Jones as a customer, while
state 2 reflects the organization without this customer. Each update
transaction changes the state of the database to reflect changes in
organizational data. Periodically, the database is copied or backed up,
possibly onto a different storage medium and stored in a secure
location. The backup is made when the database is in state 2.</p>
<p><em>Database state changes as transactions are processed</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2023/state-changes.png" /></p>
<p>A more detailed illustration of database update procedures and the
incorporation of backup facilities is shown in the following figure.</p>
<p><em>Possible procedures for a database update</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2023/procedures.png" /></p>
<p>The updating of a single record is described below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The client submits an update transaction from a workstation.</p></li>
<li><p>The transaction is edited and validated by an application program or
the DBMS. If it is valid, it is logged or stored in the transaction
log or journal. A journal or log is a special database or file that
stores information for backup and recovery.</p></li>
<li><p>The DBMS obtains the record to be updated.</p></li>
<li><p>A copy of the retrieved record is logged to the journal file. This
copy is referred to as the <em>before image</em>, because it is a copy of
the database record before the transaction changes it.</p></li>
<li><p>The transaction is processed by changing the affected data items in
the record.</p></li>
<li><p>The DBMS writes the updated record to the database.</p></li>
<li><p>A copy of the updated record is written to the journal. This copy is
referred to as the <em>after image</em>, because it is a copy of the
database record after the transaction has updated it.</p></li>
<li><p>An output message tells the application that the update has been
successfully completed.</p></li>
<li><p>The database is copied periodically. This backup copy reflects all
updates to the database up to the time when the copy was made. An
alternative strategy to periodic copying is to maintain multiple
(usually two) complete copies of the database online and update them
simultaneously. This technique, known as <em>mirroring</em>, is discussed
in Chapter 11.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to recover from data loss or damage, it is necessary to store
backup data, such as a complete copy of the database or the necessary
data to restore the accuracy of a database. Preferably, backup data
should be stored on another medium and kept separate from the primary
database. As the description of the update process indicates, there are
several options for backup data, depending on the objective of the
backup procedure.</p>

<p>Data stored for backup and recovery are generally some combination of
periodic database backups, transaction logs, and before- and after-image
logs. Different recovery strategies use different combinations of backup
data to recover a database.</p>
<p>The recovery method is highly dependent on the backup strategy. The
database administrator selects a strategy based on a trade-off between
ease of recovery from data loss or damage and the cost of performing
backup operations. For example, keeping a mirror database is more
expensive then keeping periodic database backups, but a mirroring
strategy is useful when recovery is needed very quickly, say in seconds
or minutes. An airline reservations system could use mirroring to ensure
fast and reliable recovery. In general, the cost of keeping backup data
is measured in terms of interruption of database availability (e.g.,
time the system is out of operation when a database is being restored),
storage of redundant data, and degradation of update efficiency (e.g.,
extra time taken in update processing to save before or after images).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="recovery-strategies" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Recovery strategies<a href="data-integrity.html#recovery-strategies" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The type of recovery strategy or procedure used in a given situation
depends on the nature of the data loss, the type of backup data
available, and the sophistication of the DBMS’s recovery facilities. The
following discussion outlines four major recovery strategies: switch to
a duplicate database, backward recovery or rollback, forward recovery or
roll forward, and reprocessing transactions.</p>
<p>The recovery procedure of switching to a duplicate database requires the
maintenance of the mirror copy. The other three strategies assume a
periodic dumping or backing up of the database. Periodic dumps may be
made on a regular schedule, triggered automatically by the DBMS, or
triggered externally by personnel. The schedule may be determined by
time (hourly, daily, weekly) or by event (the number of transactions
since the last backup).</p>
<div id="switching-to-a-duplicate-database" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Switching to a duplicate database<a href="data-integrity.html#switching-to-a-duplicate-database" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>This recovery procedure requires maintaining at least two copies of the
database and updating both simultaneously. When there is a problem with
one database, access is switched to the duplicate. This strategy is
particularly useful when recovery must be accomplished in seconds or
minutes. This procedure offers good protection against certain
storage-medium destruction problems, such as disk failures, but none
against events that damage or make both databases unavailable, such as a
power failure or a faulty update program. This strategy entails
additional costs in terms of doubling online storage capacity. It can
also be implemented with dual computer processors, where each computer
updates its copy of the database. This duplexed configuration offers
greater backup protection at a greater cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="backward-recovery-or-rollback" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Backward recovery or rollback<a href="data-integrity.html#backward-recovery-or-rollback" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Backward recovery (also called rollback or rolling back) is used to back
out or undo unwanted changes to the database. For example, the database
update procedures figure shows three updates (A, B, and C) to a
database. Let’s say that update B terminated abnormally, leaving the
database, now in state 3, inconsistent. What we need to do is return the
database to state 2 by applying the before images to the database. Thus,
we would perform a rollback by changing the database to state 2 with the
before images of the records updated by transaction B.</p>
<p>Backward recovery reverses the changes made when a transaction
abnormally terminates or produces erroneous results. To illustrate the
need for rollback, consider the example of a budget transfer of $1,000
between two departments.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The program reads the account record for Department X and subtracts
$1,000 from the account balance and updates the database.</p></li>
<li><p>The program then reads the record for Department Y and adds $1,000
to the account balance, but while attempting to update the database,
the program encounters a disk error and cannot write the record.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now the database is inconsistent. Department X has been updated, but
Department Y has not. Thus, the transaction must be aborted and the
database recovered. The DBMS would apply the before image to Department
X to restore the account balance to its original value. The DBMS may
then restart the transaction and make another attempt to update the
database.</p>
</div>
<div id="forward-recovery-or-roll-forward" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Forward recovery or roll forward<a href="data-integrity.html#forward-recovery-or-roll-forward" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Forward recovery (also called roll forward or bringing forward) involves
recreating a database using a prior database state. Returning to the
example in the database update procedures figure, suppose that state 4
of the database was destroyed and that we need to recover it. We would
take the last database dump or backup (state 2) and then apply the
after-image records created by update transactions B and C. This would
return the database to state 4. Thus, roll forward starts with an
earlier copy of the database, and by applying after images (the results
of good transactions), the backup copy of the database is moved forward
to a later state.</p>
</div>
<div id="reprocessing-transactions" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Reprocessing transactions<a href="data-integrity.html#reprocessing-transactions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Although similar to forward recovery, this procedure uses update
transactions instead of after images. Taking the same example shown
above, assume the database is destroyed in state 4. We would take the
last database backup (state 2) and then reprocess update transactions B
and C to return the database to state 4. The main advantage of using
this method is its simplicity. The DBMS does not need to create an
after-image journal, and there are no special restart procedures. The
one major disadvantage, however, is the length of time to reprocess
transactions. Depending on the frequency of database backups and the
time needed to get transactions into the identical sequence as previous
updates, several hours of reprocessing may be required. Processing new
transactions must be delayed until the database recovery is complete.</p>
<p>The following table reviews the three types of data losses and the
corresponding recovery strategies one could use. The major problem is to
recreate a database using a backup copy, a previous state of
organizational memory. Recovery is done through forward recovery,
reprocessing, or switching to a duplicate database if one is available.
With abnormal termination or incorrect data, the preferred strategy is
backward recovery, but other procedures could be used.</p>

<h3>Use of recovery procedures<a href="data-integrity.html#use-of-recovery-procedures" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Usually the person doing a query or an update is not concerned with
backup and recovery. Database administration personnel often implement
strategies that are automatically carried out by the DBMS. ANSI has
defined standards governing SQL processing of database transactions that
relate to recovery. Transaction support is provided through the use of
the two SQL statements COMMIT and ROLLBACK. These commands are employed
when a procedural programming language such as Java is used to update a
database. They are illustrated in the chapter on SQL and Java.</p>

<h2>Maintaining data quality<a href="data-integrity.html#maintaining-data-quality" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The second integrity goal is to maintain data quality, which typically
means keeping data accurate, complete, and current. <em>Data are
high-quality if they fit their intended uses in operations, decision
making, and planning. They are fit for use if they are free of defects
and possess desired features</em>.<a href="data-administration.html#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The preceding definition implicitly
recognizes that data quality is determined by the customer. It also
implies that data quality is relative to a task. Data could be
high-quality for one task and low-quality for another. The data provided
by a flight-tracking system are very useful when you are planning to
meet someone at the airport, but not particularly helpful for selecting
a vacation spot. Defect-free data are accessible, accurate, timely,
complete, and consistent with other sources. Desirable features include
relevance, comprehensiveness, appropriate level of detail,
easy-to-navigate source, high readability, and absence of ambiguity.</p>
<p>Poor-quality data have several detrimental effects. Customer service
decreases when there is dissatisfaction with poor and inaccurate
information or a lack of appropriate information. For many customers,
information is the heart of customer service, and they lose confidence
in firms that can’t or don’t provide relevant information. Bad data
interrupt information processing because they need to be corrected
before processing can continue. Poor-quality data can lead to a wrong
decision because inaccurate inferences and conclusions are made.</p>
<p>As we have stated previously, data quality varies with circumstances,
and the model in the following figure will help you to understand this
linkage. By considering variations in a customer’s uncertainty about a
firm’s products and a firm’s ability to deliver consistently, we arrive
at four fundamental strategies for customer-oriented data quality.</p>
<p><em>Customer-oriented data quality strategies</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2023/data-quality-strategies.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Transaction processing</strong>: When customers know what they want and firms
can deliver consistently, customers simply want fast and accurate
transactions and data confirming details of the transaction. Most
banking services fall into this category. Customers know they can
withdraw and deposit money, and banks can perform reliably.</p>
<p><strong>Expert system</strong>: In some circumstances, customers are uncertain of
their needs. For instance, Vanguard offers personal investors a choice
from more than 150 mutual funds. Most prospective investors are confused
by such a range of choices, and Vanguard, by asking a series of
questions, helps prospective investors narrow their choices and
recommends a small subset of its funds. A firm’s recommendation will
vary little over time because the characteristics of a mutual fund
(e.g., intermediate tax-exempt bond) do not change.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking</strong>: Some firms operate in environments where they don’t have a
lot of control over all the factors that affect performance. One of the busiest airports in the world, Atlanta’s Hartsfield Airport becomes congested when bad
weather, such as a summer thunderstorm, slows down operations.
Passengers clearly know what they want—data on flight delays and their
consequences. They assess data quality in terms of how well data tracks
delays and notifies them of alternative travel arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge management</strong>: When customers are uncertain about their needs
for products delivered by firms that don’t perform consistently, they
seek advice from knowledgeable people and organizations. Data quality is
judged by the soundness of the advice received. Thus, a woman wanting a
custom-built house would likely seek the advice of an architect to
select the site, design the house, and supervise its construction,
because architects are skilled in eliciting clients’ needs and
knowledgeable about the building industry.</p>
<p>An organization’s first step toward improving data quality is to
determine in which quadrant it operates so it can identify the critical
information customers expect. Of course, data quality in many situations
will be a mix of expectations. The mutual fund will be expected to
confirm fund addition and deletion transactions. However, a firm must
meet its dominant goal to attract and retain customers.</p>
<p>A firm will also need to consider its dominant data quality strategy for
its internal customers, and the same general principles illustrated by
the preceding figure can be applied. In the case of internal customers,
there can be varying degrees of uncertainty as to what other
organizational units can do for them, and these units will vary in their
ability to perform consistently for internal customers. For example,
consulting firms develop centers of excellence as repositories of
knowledge on a particular topic to provide their employees with a source
of expertise. These are the internal equivalent of knowledge centers for
external customers.</p>
<p>Once they have settled on a dominant data quality strategy,
organizations need a corporate-wide approach to data quality, just like
product and service quality. There are three generations of data
quality:
- <strong>First generation</strong>: Errors in existing data stores are found and
corrected. This data cleansing is necessary when much of the data is
captured by manual systems.
- <strong>Second generation</strong>: Errors are prevented at the source.
Procedures are put in place to capture high-quality data so that
there is no need to cleanse it later. As more data are born digital,
this approach becomes more feasible. Thus, when customers enter
their own data or barcodes are scanned, the data should be
higher-quality than when entered by a data-processing operator.
- <strong>Third generation</strong>: Defects are highly unlikely. Data capture
systems meet six-sigma standards (3.4 defects per million), and data
quality is no longer an issue.</p>

<h3>DBMS and data quality<a href="data-integrity.html#dbms-and-data-quality" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>To assist data quality, functions are needed within the DBMS to ensure
that update and insert actions are performed by authorized persons in
accordance with stated rules or integrity constraints, and that the
results are properly recorded. These functions are accomplished by
update authorization, data validation using integrity constraints, and
concurrent update control. Each of these functions is discussed in turn.</p>
<div id="update-authorization" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Update authorization<a href="data-integrity.html#update-authorization" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Without proper controls, update transactions can diminish the quality of
a database. Unauthorized users could sabotage a database by entering
erroneous values. The first step is to ensure that anyone who wants to
update a database is authorized to do so. Some responsible
person—usually the database owner or database administrator—must
tell the DBMS who is permitted to initiate particular database
operations. The DBMS must then check every transaction to ensure that it
is authorized. Unauthorized access to a database exposes an organization
to many risks, including fraud and sabotage.</p>
<p>Update authorization is accomplished through the same access mechanism
used to protect confidentiality. We will discuss access control more
thoroughly later in this chapter. In SQL, access control is implemented
through GRANT, which gives a user a privilege, and REVOKE, which removes
a privilege. (These commands are discussed in Chapter 10.) A control
mechanism may lump all update actions into a single privilege or
separate them for greater control. In SQL, they are separated as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>UPDATE (privilege to change field values using UPDATE; this can be
column specific)</li>
<li>DELETE (privilege to delete records from a table)</li>
<li>INSERT (privilege to insert records into a table)</li>
</ul>
<p>Separate privileges for each of the update commands allow tighter
controls on certain update actions, such as updating a salary field or
deleting records.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-validation-using-integrity-constraints" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Data validation using integrity constraints<a href="data-integrity.html#data-validation-using-integrity-constraints" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Once the update process has been authorized, the DBMS must ensure that a
database is accurate and complete before any updates are applied.
Consequently, the DBMS needs to be aware of any integrity constraints or
rules that apply to the data. For example, the <code>qdel</code> table in the
relational database described previously would have constraints such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery number (<code>delno</code>) must be unique, numeric, and in the range
1–99999.</li>
<li>Delivered quantity (<code>delqty</code>) must be nonzero.</li>
<li>Item name (<code>itemname</code>) must appear in the <code>qitem</code> table.</li>
<li>Supplier code (<code>splno</code>) must appear in the <code>qspl</code> table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once integrity constraints are specified, the DBMS must monitor or
validate all insert and update operations to ensure that they do not
violate any of the constraints or rules.</p>
<p>The key to updating data validation is a clear definition of valid and
invalid data. Data validation cannot be performed without integrity
constraints or rules. A person or the DBMS must know acceptable data
format, valid values, and procedures to invoke to determine validity.
All data validation is based on a prior expression of integrity
constraints.</p>
<p>Data validation may not always produce error-free data, however.
Sometimes integrity constraints are unknown or are not well defined. In
other cases, the DBMS does provide a convenient means for expressing and
performing validation checks.</p>
<p>Based on how integrity constraints have been defined, data validation
can be performed outside the DBMS by people or within the DBMS itself.
External validation is usually done by reviewing input documents before
they are entered into the system and by checking system outputs to
ensure that the database was updated correctly. Maintaining data quality
is of paramount importance, and data validation preferably should be
handled by the DBMS as much as possible rather than by the application,
which should handle the exceptions and respond to any failed data
validation checks.</p>
<p>Integrity constraints are usually specified as part of the database
definition supplied to the DBMS. For example, the primary-key uniqueness
and referential integrity constraints can be specified within the SQL
CREATE statement. DBMSs generally permit some constraints to be stored
as part of the database schema and are used by the DBMS to monitor all
update operations and perform appropriate data validation checks. Any
given database is likely to be subject to a very large number of
constraints, but not all of these can be automatically enforced by the
DBMS. Some will need to be handled by application programs.</p>
<p>The general types of constraints applied to a data item are outlined in
the following table. Not all of these necessarily would be supported by
a DBMS, and a particular database may not use all types.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Data quality control does not end with the application of integrity
constraints. Whenever an error or unusual situation is detected by the
DBMS, some form of response is required. Response rules need to be given
to the DBMS along with the integrity constraints. The responses can take
many different forms, such as abort the entire program, reject entire
update transaction, display a message and continue processing, or let
the DBMS attempt to correct the error. The response may vary depending
on the type of integrity constraint violated. If the DBMS does not allow
the specification of response rules, then it must take a default action
when an error is detected. For example, if alphabetic data are entered
in a numeric field, most DBMSs will have a default response and message
(e.g., nonnumeric data entered in numeric field). In the case of
application programs, an error code is passed to the program from the
DBMS. The program would then use this error code to execute an
error-handling procedure.</p>

<h2>Ensuring confidentiality<a href="data-integrity.html#ensuring-confidentiality" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Thus far, we have discussed how the first two goals of data integrity
can be accomplished: Data are available when needed (protecting
existence); data are accurate, complete, and current (maintaining
quality). This section deals with the final goal: ensuring
confidentiality or data security. Two DBMS functions—access control
and encryption—are the primary means of ensuring that the data are
accessed only by those authorized to do so. We begin by discussing an
overall model of data security.</p>
<div id="general-model-of-data-security" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>General model of data security<a href="data-integrity.html#general-model-of-data-security" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The following figure depicts the two functions for ensuring data
confidentiality: access control and encryption. Access control consists
of two basic steps—identification and authorization. Once past access
control, the user is permitted to access the database. Access control is
applied only to the established avenues of entry to a database. Clever
people, however, may be able to circumvent the controls and gain
unauthorized access. To counteract this possibility, it is often
desirable to hide the meaning of stored data by encrypting them, so that
it is impossible to interpret their meaning. Encrypted data are stored
in a transformed or coded format that can be decrypted and read only by
those with the appropriate key.</p>
<p><em>A general model of data security</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2023/data-security-model.png" /></p>
<p>Now let us walk through the figure in detail.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A client must be identified and provide additional information
required to authenticate this identification (e.g., an account name
and password). Client profile information (e.g., a password or a
voice print) is used to verify or authenticate a connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Having authenticated the client, the authorization step is initiated
by a request (retrieve or update database). The previously stored
client authorization rules (what data each client can access and the
authorized actions on those data) are checked to determine whether
the client has the right or privilege to access the requested data.
(The previously stored client’s privileges are created and
maintained by an authorized person, database owner, or
administrator.) A decision is made to permit or deny the execution
of the request. If access is permitted, the transaction is processed
against the database.</p></li>
<li><p>Data are encrypted before storage, and retrieved data are decrypted

<div id="data-access-control" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Data access control<a href="data-integrity.html#data-access-control" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Data access control begins with identification of an organizational
entity that can access the database. Examples are individuals,
departments, groups of people, transactions, terminals, and application
programs. Valid combinations may be required, for example, a particular
person entering a certain transaction at a particular terminal. A user
identification (often called <strong><em>userid</em></strong>) is the first piece of data
the DBMS receives from the subject. It may be a name or number. The user
identification enables the DBMS to locate the corresponding entry in the
stored user profiles and authorization tables (see preceding figure).</p>
<p>Taking this information, the DBMS goes through the process of
authentication. The system attempts to match additional information
supplied by the client with the information previously stored in the
client’s profile. The system may perform multiple matches to ensure the
identity of the client (see the following table for the different
types). If all tests are successful, the DBMS assumes that the subject
is an authenticated client.</p>

<p>Many systems use remembered information to control access. The problem
with such information is that it does not positively identify the
client. Passwords have been the most widely used form of access control.
If used correctly, they can be very effective. Unfortunately, people
leave them around where others can pick them up, allowing unauthorized
people to gain access to databases.</p>
<p>To deal with this problem, organizations are moving toward using
personal characteristics and combinations of authenticating mechanisms
to protect sensitive data. Collectively, these mechanisms can provide
even greater security. For example, access to a large firm’s very
valuable marketing database requires a smart card and a fingerprint, a
combination of personal characteristic and a possessed object. The
database can be accessed through only a few terminals in specific
locations, an isolation strategy. Once the smart card test is passed,
the DBMS requests entry of other remembered information—password and
account number—before granting access.</p>
<p>Data access authorization is the process of permitting clients whose
identity has been authenticated to perform certain operations on certain
data objects in a shared database. The authorization process is driven
by rules incorporated into the DBMS. Authorization rules are in a table
that includes subjects, objects, actions, and constraints for a given
database. An example of such a table is shown in the following table.
Each row of the table indicates that a particular subject is authorized
to take a certain action on a database object, perhaps depending on some
constraint. For example, the last entry of the table indicates that
Brier is authorized to delete supplier records with no restrictions.</p>

<p>We have already discussed subjects, but not objects, actions, and
constraints. Objects are database entities protected by the DBMS.
Examples are databases, views, files, tables, and data items. In the
preceding table, the objects are all tables. A view is another form of
security. It restricts the client’s access to a database. Any data not
included in a view are unknown to the client. Although views promote
security, several persons may share a view or unauthorized persons may
gain access. Thus, a view is another object to be included in the
authorization process. Typical actions on objects are shown in the
table: read, insert, modify, and delete. Constraints are particular
rules that apply to a subject-action-object relationship.</p>
<div id="implementing-authorization-rules" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Implementing authorization rules<a href="data-integrity.html#implementing-authorization-rules" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Most contemporary DBMSs do not implement the complete authorization
table shown in the table. Usually, they implement a simplified version.
The most common form is an authorization table for subjects with limited
applications of the constraint column. Let us take the granting of table
privileges, which are needed in order to authorize subjects to perform
operations on both tables and views.</p>

<p>Because authorization tables contain highly sensitive data, they must be
protected by stringent security rules and encryption. Normally, only
selected persons in data administration have authority to access and
modify them.</p>

<div id="encryption" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Encryption<a href="data-integrity.html#encryption" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Encryption techniques complement access control. As the preceding figure
illustrates, access control applies only to established avenues of
access to a database. There is always the possibility that people will
circumvent these controls and gain unauthorized access to a database. To
counteract this possibility, encryption can be used to obscure or hide
the meaning of data. Encrypted data cannot be read by an intruder unless
that person knows the method of encryption and has the key. Encryption
is any transformation applied to data that makes it difficult to extract
meaning. Encryption transforms data into cipher text or disguised
information, and decryption reconstructs the original data from cipher
text.</p>
<p><strong>Public-key encryption</strong> is based on a pair of private and public keys.
A person’s public key can be freely distributed because it is quite
separate from his or her private key. To send and receive messages,
communicators first need to create private and public keys and then
exchange their public keys. The sender encodes a message with the
intended receiver’s public key, and upon receiving the message, the
receiver applies her private key. The receiver’s private key, the only
one that can decode the message, must be kept secret to provide secure
message exchanging.</p>
<p><em>Public-key encryption</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2023/public-key.png" /></p>
<p>In a DBMS environment, encryption techniques can be applied to
transmitted data sent over communication lines to and from devices, or
between computers, and to all highly sensitive stored data in active
databases or their backup versions. Some DBMS products include routines
that automatically encrypt sensitive data when they are stored or
transmitted over communication channels. Other DBMS products provide
exits that allow users to code their own encryption routines. Encrypted
data may also take less storage space because they are often compressed.</p>

<h3>Monitoring activity<a href="data-integrity.html#monitoring-activity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes no single activity will be detected as an example of misuse of
a system. However, examination of a pattern of behavior may reveal
undesirable behavior (e.g., persistent attempts to log into a system
with a variety of userids and passwords). Many systems now monitor all
activity using <strong>audit trail analysis</strong>. A time- and date-stamped audit
trail of all system actions (e.g., database accesses) is maintained.
This audit log is dynamically analyzed to detect unusual behavior
patterns and alert security personnel to possible misuse.</p>
<p>A form of misuse can occur when an authorized user violates privacy
rules by using a series of authorized queries to gain access to private
data. For example, some systems aim to protect individual privacy by
restricting authorized queries to aggregate functions (e.g., AVG and
COUNT). Since it is impossible to do non-aggregate queries, this
approach should prevent access to individual-level data, which it does
at the single-query level. However, multiple queries can be constructed
to circumvent this restriction.</p>

<p>The preceding set of queries, while all at the aggregate level, enables
one to deduce the salary of the professor. This is an invasion of
privacy and counter to the spirit of the restriction queries to
aggregate functions. An audit trail should detect such <strong>tracker
queries</strong>, one or more authorized queries that collectively violate
privacy. One approach to preventing tracker queries is to set a lower
bound on the number of rows on which a query can report.</p>

<div id="summary-23" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Summary<a href="data-integrity.html#summary-23" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The management of organizational data is driven by the joint goals of
availability and integrity. Availability deals with making data
available to whoever needs them, whenever and wherever they need them,
and in a meaningful form. Maintaining integrity implies protecting
existence, maintaining quality, and ensuring confidentiality. There are
three strategies for maintaining data integrity: legal, administrative,
and technical. A consistent database is one in which all data integrity
constraints are satisfied.</p>
<p>A transaction must be entirely completed or aborted before there is any
effect on the database. Transactions are processed as logical units of
work to ensure data integrity. The transaction manager is responsible
for ensuring that transactions are correctly recorded.</p>
<p>Concurrent update control focuses on making sure updated results are
correctly recorded in a database. To prevent loss of updates and
inconsistent retrieval results, a DBMS must incorporate a
resource-locking mechanism. Deadlock is an impasse that occurs because
two users lock certain resources, then request resources locked by each
other. Deadlock prevention requires applications to lock all required
records at the beginning of the transaction. Deadlock resolution uses
the DBMS to detect and break deadlocks.</p>
<p>Isolation is a preventive strategy that involves administrative
procedures to insulate the physical database from destruction. Database
backup and recovery is a curative strategy that protects an existing
database and recreates or recovers the data whenever loss or destruction
occurs. A DBMS needs to provide backup, journaling, and recovery
facilities to restore a database to a consistent state and restart the
processing of transactions. A journal or log is a special database or
file that stores information for backup and recovery. A before image is
a copy of a database record before a transaction changes the record. An
after image is a copy of a database record after a transaction has
updated the record.</p>
<p>In order to recover from data loss or damage, it is necessary to store
redundant, backup data. The recovery method is highly dependent on the
backup strategy. The cost of keeping backup data is measured in terms of
interruption of database availability, storage of redundant data, and
degradation of update efficiency. The four major recovery strategies are
switching to a duplicate database, backward recovery or rollback,
forward recovery or roll forward, and reprocessing transactions.
Database administration personnel often implement recovery strategies
automatically carried out by the DBMS. The SQL statements COMMIT and
ROLLBACK are used with a procedural programming language for
implementing recovery procedures.</p>
<p>Maintaining quality implies keeping data accurate, complete, and
current. The first step is to ensure that anyone wanting to update a
database is required to have authorization. In SQL, access control is
implemented through GRANT and REVOKE. Data validation cannot be
performed without integrity constraints or rules. Data validation can be
performed external to the DBMS by personnel or within the DBMS based on
defined integrity constraints. Because maintaining data quality is of
paramount importance, it is desirable that the DBMS handles data
validation rather than the application. Error response rules need to be
given to the DBMS along with the integrity constraints.</p>
<p>Two DBMS functions, access control and encryption, are the primary
mechanisms for ensuring that the data are accessed only by authorized
persons. Access control consists of identification and authorization.
Data access authorization is the process of permitting users whose
identities have been authenticated to perform certain operations on
certain data objects. Encrypted data cannot be read by an intruder
unless that person knows the method of encryption and has the key. In a
DBMS environment, encryption can be applied to data sent over
communication lines between computers and data storage devices.</p>
<p>Database activity is monitored to detect patterns of activity indicating
misuse of the system. An audit trail is maintained of all system
actions. A tracker query is a series of aggregate function queries
designed to reveal individual-level data.</p>

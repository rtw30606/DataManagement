<h2>Introduction<a href="information.html#introduction-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There are three characteristics of the first two decades of the twenty-first
century: global warming, high-velocity global change, and the emerging
power of information organizations.<a href="data-administration.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The need to create a
sustainable civilization, the globalization of business, and the rise of
China as a major economic power are major forces contributing to mass
change. Organizations are undergoing large-scale restructuring as they
attempt to reposition themselves to survive the threats and exploit the
opportunities presented by these changes.</p>
<p>This century, some very powerful and highly profitable
information-based organizations have emerged. In 20212, Apple and Microsoft vied to be the
world’s largest company in terms of market value. Leveraging the iPhone
and IOS, Apple has shown the power of information services to change an
industry. Google has become a well-known global brand as it fulfills its
mission “to organize the world’s information and make it universally
accessible and useful.” Amazon is disrupting traditional retail.
Facebook has digitized our social world, and Microsoft has dominated the
office environment for decades. We gain further insights into the value
of information by considering its role in civilization.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-historical-perspective" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>A historical perspective<a href="information.html#a-historical-perspective" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Humans have been collecting data to manage their affairs for several
thousand years. In 3000 BCE, Mesopotamians recorded inventory details in
cuneiform, an early script. Today’s society transmits Exabytes of data
every day as billions of people and millions of organizations manage
their affairs. The dominant issue facing each type of economy has
changed over time, and the collection and use of data has changed to
reflect these concerns, as shown in the following table.</p>
<p><em>Societal focus</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%202/societal%20focus.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Agrarian society</strong> was concerned with productive farming, and an important
issue was when to plant crops. Ancient Egypt, for example, based its
calendar on the flooding of the Nile. The focus shifted during the
<strong>industrial era</strong> to management of resources (e.g., raw materials, labor,
logistics). Accounting, ERP, and project management became key
information systems for managing resources. In the current <strong>service
economy</strong>, the focus has shifted to customer creation. There is an
oversupply of many consumer products (e.g., cars) and companies compete
to identify services and product features that will attract customers.
They are concerned with determining what types of customers to recruit
and finding out what they want. As a result, we have seen the rise of
business analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) to address
this dominant issue. As well as creating customers, firms need to serve
those already recruited. High quality service often requires frequent
and reliable execution of multiple processes during manifold encounters
with customers by a firm’s many customer facing employees (e.g., a quick service restaurant, an airline, a hospital). Consequently, business process
management (BPM) has grown in importance since the mid 1990s when there
was a surge of interest in business process reengineering.</p>
<p>We are in transition to a new era, <strong>sustainability</strong>, where attention
shifts to assessing environmental impact because, after several
centuries of industrialization, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels have become
alarmingly high. We are also <a href="https://www.earthday.org">exceeding the limits of the planet’s
resources</a> as global population nears eight billion people. As a
result, a new class of application is emerging, such as environmental
management systems and UPS’s telematics project.<a href="data-administration.html#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> These
new systems will also include, for example, support for understanding
environmental impact through simulation of energy consumption and
production systems, optimization of energy systems, and design of low
impact production and customer service systems. Notice that dominant
issues don’t disappear but rather aggregate in layers, so today’s
business will be concerned with survival, production, customer service,
and sustainability. As a result, a firm’s need for data never
diminishes, and each new layer creates another set of data needs. The
flood will not subside and for most firms the data flow will need to
grow significantly to meet the new challenge of sustainability.</p>
<p>A constant across all of these economies is organizational memory, or in
its larger form, social memory. Writing and paper manufacturing
developed about the same time as agricultural societies. Limited writing
systems appeared about 30,000 years ago. Full writing systems, which
have evolved in the last 5,000 years, made possible the technological
transfer that enabled humanity to move from hunting and gathering to
farming. Writing enables the recording of knowledge, and information can
accumulate from one generation to the next. Before writing, knowledge
was confined by the limits of human memory.</p>
<p>There is a need for a technology that can store knowledge for extended
periods and support the transport of written information. Storage medium has
advanced from clay tablets (4000 BCE), papyrus (3500 BCE), and parchment
(2000 BCE) to paper (100 CE). Written knowledge gained great impetus
from Johannes Gutenberg, whose achievement was a printing system
involving movable metal type, ink, paper, and press. In less than 50
years, printing technology diffused throughout most of Europe. In the
last century, a range of new storage media appeared (e.g., photographic,
magnetic, and optical).</p>
<p>Organizational memories emerged with the development of large
organizations such as governments, armies, churches, and trading
companies. The growth of organizations during the industrial revolution
saw a massive increase in the number and size of organizational
memories. This escalation continued throughout the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The Internet has demonstrated that we now live in a borderless world.
There is a free flow of information, investment, and industry across
borders. Customers ignore national boundaries to buy products and
services. In the borderless information age, the old ways of creating
wealth have been displaced by intelligence, marketing, global reach, and
education. Excelling in the management of data, information, and
knowledge has become a prerequisite for corporate and national wealth.</p>

<p>This brief history shows the increasing importance of information.
Civilization was facilitated by the discovery of means for recording and
disseminating information. In our current society, organizations are the
predominant keepers and transmitters of information.</p>

<h2>A brief history of information systems<a href="information.html#a-brief-history-of-information-systems" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Information systems has three significant eras. In the first era,
information work was transported to the computer. For instance, a
punched card deck was physically transported to a computer center, the
information was processed, and the output physically returned to the
worker as a printout.</p>

<p>In the second era, private networks were used to take information work
to the employee. Initially, these were time-sharing and host/terminal
systems. IS departments were concerned primarily with creating systems
for use by an organization’s employees when interacting with customers
(e.g., a hotel reservation system used by call center employees) or for
the employees of another business to transact with the organization
(e.g., clerks in a hospital ordering supplies).</p>
<p>Era 3 starts with the appearance of the Web browser in the mid-1990s.
The browser, which can be used on the public and global Internet,
permits organizations to take information and information work to
customers and other stakeholders. Now, the customer undertakes work
previously done by the organization (e.g., making an airline
reservation).</p>
<p>The scale and complexity of era 3 is at least an order of magnitude
greater than that of era 2. Nearly every company has far more customers
than employees. For example, UPS, with an annual investment of billions in information systems and over 500,000 employees, is one
of the world’s largest employers. However, there are over 11 million
customers, over 20 times the number of employees, who are
electronically connected to UPS.</p>
<p>Era 3 introduced direct electronic links between a firm and its
stakeholders, such as investors and citizens. In the earlier eras,
intermediaries often communicated with stakeholders on behalf of the
firm (e.g., a press release to the news media). These messages could be
filtered and edited, or sometimes possibly ignored, by intermediaries.
Now, organizations can communicate directly with their stakeholders via
the Web, e-mail, social media. Internet technologies offer firms a
chance to rethink their goals vis-à-vis each stakeholder class and to
use Internet technology to pursue these goals.</p>
<p>This brief history leads to the conclusion that the value IS creates is
determined by whom an organization can reach, how it can reach them, and
where and when it can reach them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Who</strong>. Who an organization can contact determines whom it can
influence, inform, or transfer work to. For example, if a hotel can
be contacted electronically by its customers, it can promote online
reservations (transfer work to customers), and reduce its costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How</strong>. How an organization reaches a stakeholder determines the
potential success of the interaction. The higher the bandwidth of
the connection, the richer the message (e.g., using video instead of
text), the greater the amount of information that can be conveyed,
and the more information work that can be transferred.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Where</strong>. Value is created when customers get information directly
related to their current location (e.g., a navigation system) and
what local services they want to consume (e.g., the nearest Italian
restaurant).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When</strong>. When a firm delivers a service to a client can greatly
determine its value. Stockbrokers, for instance, who can inform
clients immediately of critical corporate news or stock market
movements are likely to get more business.</p></li>

<div id="information-characteristics" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Information characteristics<a href="information.html#information-characteristics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Three useful concepts for describing information are hardness, richness,
and class. Information hardness is a subjective measure of the accuracy
and reliability of an item of information. Information richness
describes the concept that information can be rich or lean depending on
the information delivery medium. Information class groups types of
information by their key features.</p>
<div id="information-hardness" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Information hardness<a href="information.html#information-hardness" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In 1812, the Austrian mineralogist Friedrich Mohs proposed a scale of
hardness, in order of increasing relative hardness, based on 10 common
minerals. Each mineral can scratch those with the same or a lower
number, but cannot scratch higher-numbered minerals.</p>
<p>A similar approach can be used to describe information. Market
information, such as the current price of gold, is the hardest because
it is measured extremely accurately. There is no ambiguity, and its
measurement is highly reliable. In contrast, the softest information,
which comes from unidentified sources, is rife with uncertainty.</p>

</table>
<p>Audited financial statements are in the corundum zone. They are measured
according to standard rules (known as “generally accepted accounting
principles”) that are promulgated by national accounting societies.
External auditors monitor the application of these standards, although
there is generally some leeway in their application and sometimes
multiple standards for the same item. The use of different accounting
principles can lead to different profit and loss statements. As a
result, the information in audited financial statements has some degree
of uncertainty.</p>
<p>There are degrees of hardness within accounting systems. The hardest
data are counts, such as units sold or customers served. These are
primary measures of organizational performance. Secondary measures, such
as dollar sales and market share, are derived from counts. Managers vary
in their preference for primary and secondary measures. Operational
managers opt for counts for measuring productivity because they are
uncontaminated by price changes and currency fluctuations. Senior
managers, because their focus is on financial performance, select
secondary measures.</p>
<p>The scratch test provides a convenient and reliable method of assessing
the hardness of a mineral. Unfortunately, there is no scratch test for
information. Managers must rely on their judgment to assess information
hardness.</p>
<p>Although managers want hard information, there are many cases when it is
not available from a single source. They compensate by seeking information from several different places. Relatively consistent information from
multiple sources is reassuring.</p>
</div>
<div id="information-richness" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Information richness<a href="information.html#information-richness" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Information can be described as rich or lean. It is richest when
delivered face-to-face. Conversation permits immediate feedback for
verification of meaning. You can always stop the other speaker and ask,
“What do you mean?” Face-to-face information delivery is rich because
you see the speaker’s body language, hear the tone of voice, and natural
language is used. A numeric document is the leanest form of information.
There is no opportunity for questions, no additional information from

communication media is shown in the following table.</p>

<p>Managers seek rich information when they are trying to resolve
equivocality or ambiguity, which means that managers cannot make sense of a
situation because they arrive at multiple, conflicting interpretations
of the information. An example of an equivocal situation is a class
assignment where some of the instructions are missing and others are
contradictory (of course, this example is an extremely rare event).</p>
<p>Equivocal situations cannot be resolved by collecting more information,
because managers are uncertain about what questions to ask and often a
clear answer is not possible. Managers reduce equivocality by sharing
their interpretations of the available information and reaching a
collective understanding of what the information means. By exchanging
opinions and recalling their experiences, they try to make sense of an
ambiguous situation.</p>
<p>Many of the situations that managers face each day involve a high degree
of equivocality. Formal organizational memories, such as databases, are
not much help, because the information they provide is lean. Many
managers rely far more on talking with colleagues and using informal
organizational memories such as social networks.</p>
<p>Data management is almost exclusively concerned with administering the
formal information systems that deliver lean information. Although this
is their proper role, data managers must realize that they can deliver
only a portion of the data required by decision makers.</p>

<div id="information-classes" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Information classes<a href="information.html#information-classes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Information can be grouped into four categories: content, form, behavior,
and action. Until recently, most organizational information fell into
the first class.</p>

<p>Content information records details about quantity, location, and types
of items. It tends to be historical in nature and is traditionally the
class of information collected and stored by organizations. The content
information of a car would describe its model number, color, price,
options, horsepower, and so forth. Hundreds of bytes of data may be
required to record the full content information of a car. Typically,
content data are captured by a TPS.</p>
<p>Form information describes the shape and composition of an object. For
example, the form information of a car would define the dimensions and
composition of every component in it. Millions of bytes of data are
needed to store the form of a car. CAD/CAM systems are used to create
and store form information.</p>
<p>Behavior information is used to predict the responses of a physical
object using simulation techniques. Such systems typically require a combination of input data and mathematical equations. Massive numbers of calculations per second are
required to simulate behavior. For example, simulating the flight of a
new aircraft design may require trillions of computations. Behavior
information is often presented visually because the vast volume of data
generated cannot be easily processed by humans in other formats.</p>
<p>Action information enables the instantaneous creation of sophisticated
action. Industrial robots take action information and manufacture parts,
weld car bodies, or transport items. Antilock brakes are an example of
action information in use.</p>

<div id="information-and-organizational-change" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Information and organizational change<a href="information.html#information-and-organizational-change" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Organizations are goal-directed. They undergo continual change as they
use their resources, people, technology, and financial assets to reach
some future desired outcome. Goals are often clearly stated, such as to
make a profit of USD 100 million, win a football championship, or decrease
the government deficit by 25 percent in five years. Goals are often not
easily achieved, however, and organizations continually seek information
that supports goal attainment. The information they seek falls into
three categories: goal setting, gap, and change.</p>
<p><em>Organizational information categories</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%202/gap%20model.jpg" /></p>
<p>The emergence of an information society also means that information
provides dual possibilities for change. Information is used to plan
change, and information is a medium for change.</p>
<div id="goal-setting-information" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Goal-setting information<a href="information.html#goal-setting-information" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Organizations set goals or levels of desired performance. Managers need
information to establish goals that are challenging but realistic. A
common approach is to take the previous goal and stretch it. For
example, a company with a 15 percent return on investment (ROI) might
set the new goal at 17 percent ROI. This technique is known as
“anchoring and adjusting.” Prior performance is used as a basis for
setting the new performance standards. The problem with anchoring and
adjusting is that it promotes incremental improvement rather than
radical change because internal information is used to set performance
standards. Some organizations have turned to external information and
are using benchmarking as a source of information for goal setting.</p>
</div>
<div id="planning" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Planning<a href="information.html#planning" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Planning is an important task for senior managers. To set the direction
for the company, they need information about consumers’ potential
demands and social, economic, technical, and political conditions. They
use this information to determine the opportunities and threats facing
the organization, thus permitting them to take advantage of
opportunities and avoid threats.</p>
<p>Most of the information for long-term planning comes from sources
external to the company. There are think tanks that analyze trends and
publish reports on future conditions. Journal articles and books can be
important sources of information about future events. There will also be
a demand for some internal information to identify trends in costs and
revenues. Major planning decisions, such as building a new plant, will
be based on an analysis of internal data (use of existing capacity) and
external data (projected customer demand).</p>
</div>
<div id="benchmarking" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Benchmarking<a href="information.html#benchmarking" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Benchmarking establishes goals based on best industry practices. It is
founded on the Japanese concept of <em>dantotsu</em>, striving to be the best
of the best. Benchmarking is externally directed. Information is sought
on those companies, regardless of industry, that demonstrate outstanding
performance in the areas to be benchmarked. Their methods are studied,
documented, and used to set goals and redesign existing practices for
superior performance.</p>
<p>Other forms of external information, such as demographic trends,
economic forecasts, and competitors’ actions can be used in goal
setting. External information is valuable because it can force an
organization to go beyond incremental goal setting.</p>
<p>Organizations need information to identify feasible, motivating, and
challenging goals. Once these goals have been established, they need
information on the extent to which these goals have been attained.</p>
</div>
<div id="gap-information" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Gap information<a href="information.html#gap-information" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Because goals are meant to be challenging, there is often a gap between
actual and desired performance. Organizations use a number of mechanisms
to detect a gap and gain some idea of its size. Problem identification
and scorekeeping are two principal methods of providing gap information.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-identification" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Problem identification<a href="information.html#problem-identification" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Business conditions are continually changing because of competitors’
actions, trends in consumer demand, and government actions. Often these
changes are reflected in a gap between expectations and present
performance. This gap is often called a problem.</p>
<p>To identify problems, managers use exception reports, which are
generated when conditions vary from the established goal or
standard. Once a potential problem has been identified, managers collect
additional information to confirm that a problem really exists. Once
management has been alerted, the information delivery system needs to
shift into high gear. Managers will request rapid delivery of ad hoc
reports from a variety of sources. The ideal organizational memory
system can adapt smoothly to deliver appropriate information quickly.</p>
</div>
<div id="scorekeeping" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Scorekeeping<a href="information.html#scorekeeping" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Keeping track of the score provides gap information. Managers ask many
questions: How many items did we make yesterday? What were the sales
last week? Has our market share increased in the last year? They
establish measurement systems to track variables that indicate whether
organizational performance is on target. Keeping score is important;
managers need to measure in order to manage. Also, measurement lets
people know what is important. Once a manager starts to measure
something, subordinates surmise that this variable must be important and
pay more attention to the factors that influence it.</p>
<p>There are many aspects of the score that a manager can measure. The
overwhelming variety of potentially available information is illustrated
by the sales output information that a sales manager could track. Sales
input information (e.g., number of service calls) can also be measured,
and there is qualitative information to be considered. Because of time
constraints, most managers are forced to limit their attention to 10 or
fewer key variables singled out by the critical success factors (CSF)
method.<a href="data-administration.html#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Scorekeeping information is usually fairly
stable.</p>

<h3>Change information<a href="information.html#change-information" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Accurate change information is very valuable because it enables managers
to predict the outcome of various actions to close a gap with some
certainty. Unfortunately, change information is usually not very
precise, and there are many variables that can influence the effect of
any planned change. Nevertheless, organizations spend a great deal of
time collecting information to support problem solving and planning.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-solution" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Problem solution<a href="information.html#problem-solution" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Once a concern has been identified, a manager seeks to find its cause. A
decrease in sales could be the result of competitors introducing a new
product, an economic downturn, an ineffective advertising campaign, or
many other reasons. Data can be collected to test each of these possible
causes. Additional data are usually required to support analysis of each
alternative. For example, if the sales decrease has been caused by an
economic recession, the manager might use a decision support system
(DSS) to analyze the effect of a price decrease or a range of
promotional activities.</p>
</div>
<div id="information-as-a-means-of-change" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Information as a means of change<a href="information.html#information-as-a-means-of-change" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The emergence of an information society means that information can be
used as a means of changing an organization’s performance. Corporations
can create information-based products and services, adding information
to products, and using information to enhance existing performance or
gain a competitive advantage. Further insights into the use of
information as a change agent are gained by examining marketing,
customer service, and empowerment.</p>
</div>
<div id="marketing" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Marketing<a href="information.html#marketing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Marketing is a key strategy for changing organizational performance by
increasing sales. Information has become an important component in
marketing. Airlines and retailers have established frequent flyer and
buyer programs to encourage customer loyalty and gain more information
about customers. These systems are heavily dependent on database
technology because of the massive volume of data that must be stored.
Indeed, without database technology, some marketing strategies could
never be implemented.</p>
<p>Database technology offers the opportunity to change the very nature of
communications with customers. Broadcast media have been the traditional
approach to communication. Advertisements are aired on television,
placed in magazines, or displayed on a Web site. Database technology can
be used to address customers directly. No longer just a mailing list,
today’s database can be a memory of customer relationships, a record of
every message and response between the firm and a customer. Some
companies keep track of customers’ preferences and customize
advertisements to their needs. Leading online retailers now send
customers only those emails for products for which they estimate there
is a high probability of a purchase. For example, a customer with a
history of streaming jazz music is sent an email promoting a jazz concert in their city.</p>
<p>The Web has significantly enhanced the value of database technology.
Many firms now use a combination of a Web site and a DBMS to market
products and service customers.</p>
</div>
<div id="customer-service" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Customer Service<a href="information.html#customer-service" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Many business leaders consider customer service as a critical
goal for organizational success. Many of the developed
economies are service driven. In the United States, services account for
nearly 80 percent of the GNP and most of the new jobs. Many companies
now compete for customers by offering superior customer service.
Information is frequently a key to this improved service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❓ <em>Skill builder</em></p>
<p>For many businesses, information is the key to high-quality customer
service. Some firms use information, and thus customer service,
as a key differentiating factor, while others might compete on price.
Compare the electronics component of Web sites Amazon and Walmart. How
do they use price and information to compete? What are the
implications for data management if a firm uses information to
compete?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="empowerment" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Empowerment<a href="information.html#empowerment" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Empowerment means giving employees greater freedom to make decisions.
More precisely, it is sharing with frontline employees</p>
<ul>
<li><p>information about the organization’s performance;</p></li>
<li><p>rewards based on the organization’s performance;</p></li>
<li><p>knowledge and information that enable employees to understand and
contribute to organizational performance;</p></li>
<li><p>power to make decisions that influence organizational direction and
performance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that information features prominently in the process. A critical
component is giving employees access to the information they need to
perform their tasks with a high degree of independence and discretion.
Information is empowerment. By linking employees to organizational
memory, data managers play a pivotal role in empowering people.
Empowerment can contribute to organizational performance by increasing
the quality of products and services. Together, empowerment and
information are mechanisms of planned change.</p>

<div id="information-and-managerial-work" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Information and managerial work<a href="information.html#information-and-managerial-work" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Because managers frequently use data management systems in their normal
activities as a source of information about change and as a means of
implementing change, it is crucial for systems designers to understand
how managers work. Failure to take account of managerial behavior can
result in a system that is technically sound but rarely used because it
does not fit the social system.</p>
<p>Studies over several decades reveal a very consistent pattern:
Managerial work is very fragmented. Managers spend an average of 10
minutes on any task, and their day is organized into brief periods of
concentrated attention to a variety of tasks. They work unrelentingly
and are frequently interrupted by unexpected disturbances. Managers are
action oriented and rely on intuition and judgment far more than
contemplative analysis of information.</p>
<p>Managers strongly prefer oral communication. They spend a great deal of
time conversing directly or by telephone. Managers use interpersonal
communication to establish networks and build social capital, which they later use as a source of
information and a way to influence outcomes. The continual flow of
verbal information helps them make sense of events and lets them feel
the organizational pulse.</p>
<p>Managers rarely use formal reporting systems. They do not spend a lot of
time analyzing computer reports or querying databases but resort to
formal reports to confirm impressions, should interpersonal
communications suggest there is a problem. Even when managers are
provided with a purpose-built, ultra-friendly executive information
system, their behavior changes very little. They may access a few
screens during the day, but oral communication is still their preferred
method of data gathering and dissemination.</p>
</div>
<div id="managers-information-requirements" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Managers’ information requirements<a href="information.html#managers-information-requirements" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Managers have certain requirements of the information they receive.
These expectations should shape a data management system’s content and
how data are processed and presented.</p>
<p>Managers expect to receive information that is useful for their current
task under existing business conditions. Unfortunately, managerial tasks
can change rapidly. The interlinked, global, economic environment is
highly turbulent. Since managers’ expectations are not stable, the
information delivery system must be sufficiently flexible to meet
changing requirements.</p>
<p>Managers’ demands for information vary with their perception of its
hardness; they require only one source that scores 10 on the information
hardness scale. The Nikkei Index at the close of today’s market is the
same whether you read it in the <em>Asian Wall Street Journal</em> or <em>The
Western Australian</em> or hear it on CNN. As perceived hardness decreases,
managers demand more information, hoping to resolve uncertainty and gain
a more accurate assessment of the situation. When the reliability of a
source is questionable, managers seek confirmation from other sources.
If a number of different sources provide consistent information, a
manager gains confidence in the information’s accuracy.</p>
<p><em>Relationship of perceived information hardness to volume of information
requested</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%202/hardness-volume%20tradeoff.png" /></p>
<p>It is not unusual, therefore, to have a manager seek information from a
database, a conversation with a subordinate, and a contact in another
organization. If a manager gets essentially the same information from
each source, they have the confirmation they sought. This means each data
management system should be designed to minimize redundancy, but
different components of organizational memory can supply overlapping
information.</p>
<div id="managers-needs-for-information-vary-accordingly-with-responsibilities" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Managers’ needs for information vary accordingly with responsibilities<a href="information.html#managers-needs-for-information-vary-accordingly-with-responsibilities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Operational managers need detailed, short-term information to deal with
well-defined problems in areas such as sales, service, and production.
This information comes almost exclusively from internal sources that
report recent performance in the manager’s area. A sales manager may get
weekly reports of sales by each direct report.</p>
<p>As managers move up the organizational hierarchy, their information
needs both expand and contract. They become responsible for a wider
range of activities and are charged with planning the future of the
organization, which requires information from external sources on
long-term economic, demographic, political, and social trends. Despite
this long-term focus, top-level managers also monitor short-term,
operational performance. In this instance, they need less detail and
more summary and exception reports on a small number of key indicators.
To avoid information overload as new layers of information needs are
added, the level of detail on the old layers naturally must decline, as
illustrated in the following figure.</p>
<p><em>Management level and information need</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%202/onion%20model.jpg" /></p>

<div id="information-satisficing" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Information satisficing<a href="information.html#information-satisficing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Because managers face making many decisions in a short period, most do
not have the time or resources to collect and interpret all the
information they need to make the best decision. Consequently, they are
often forced to satisfice. That is, they accept the first satisfactory
decision they discover. They also satisfice in their information search,
collecting only enough information to make a satisfactory decision.</p>
<p>Ultimately, information satisficing leads to lower-quality decision
making. If, however, information systems can accelerate delivery and
processing of the right information, then managers should be able to
move beyond selecting the first satisfactory decision to selecting the
best of several satisfactory decisions.</p>

<h2>Information delivery systems<a href="information.html#information-delivery-systems" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Most organizations have a variety of delivery systems to provide
information to managers. Developed over many years, these systems are
integrated, usually via a Web site, to give managers better access to
information. There are two aspects to information delivery. First, there
is a need for software that accesses an organizational memory, extracts
the required data, and formats it for presentation. We can use the
categories of organizational memories introduced in Chapter 1 to
describe the software side of information delivery systems. The second
aspect of delivery is the hardware that gets information from a computer
to the manager.</p>

<p>Software is used to move data to and from organizational memory. There
is usually tight coupling between software and the format of an
organizational memory. For example, a relational database management
system can access tables but not decision-support models. This tight
coupling is particularly frustrating for managers who often want
integrated information from several organizational memories. For
example, a sales manager might expect a monthly report to include
details of recent sales (from a relational database) to be combined with
customer comments (from email messages to a customer service system). A
quick glance at the preceding table shows that there are many different
information delivery systems. We will discuss each of these briefly to
illustrate the lack of integration of organizational memories.</p>
<div id="verbal-exchange" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Verbal exchange<a href="information.html#verbal-exchange" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Conversations, meetings, and oral reporting are commonly used methods of
information delivery. Indeed, managers show a strong preference for
verbal exchange as a method for gathering information. This is not
surprising because we are accustomed to oral information. This is the
way we learned for thousands of years as a preliterate culture. Only
recently have we learned to make decisions using
computer reports and visuals.</p>
</div>
<div id="voice-mail" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Voice mail<a href="information.html#voice-mail" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Voice mail is useful for people who do not want to be interrupted. It
supports asynchronous communication; that is, the two parties to the
conversation are not simultaneously connected. Voice-mail systems also
can store many prerecorded messages that can be selectively replayed
using a phone’s keypad. Organizations use this feature to support
standard customer queries.</p>
</div>
<div id="electronic-mail" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Electronic mail<a href="information.html#electronic-mail" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Email is an important system of information delivery. It too supports
asynchronous messaging, and it is less costly than voice mail for
communication. Many documents are exchanged as attachments to email.</p>
</div>
<div id="formal-report" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Formal report<a href="information.html#formal-report" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Formal reports have a long history in organizations. Before electronic
communication, they were the main form of information delivery. They
still have a role in organizations because they are an effective method
of integrating information of varying hardness and from a variety of
organizational memories. For example, a report can contain text, tables,
graphics, and images.</p>
<p>Formal reports are often supplemented by a verbal presentation of the
key points in the report. Such a presentation enhances the information
delivered, because the audience has an opportunity to ask questions and
get an immediate response.</p>

<h3>Meetings<a href="information.html#meetings" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Because managers spend 30-80 percent of their time in meetings, these
are a key source of information.</p>

<h3>Groupware<a href="information.html#groupware" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Since meetings occupy so much managerial time and in many cases are
poorly planned and managed, organizations are looking for improvements.
Groupware is a general term applied to a range of software systems
designed to improve some aspect of group work. It is excellent for
tapping soft information and the informal side of organizational memory.</p>

<h3>Image processing system<a href="information.html#image-processing-system" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>An image processing system (IPS) captures data using a scanner to
digitize an image. Images in the form of letters, reports,
illustrations, and graphics have always been an important type of
organizational memory. An IPS permits these forms of information to be
captured electronically and disseminated.</p>

<h3>Computer-aided design<a href="information.html#computer-aided-design" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Computer-aided design (CAD) is used extensively to create graphics. For
example, engineers use CAD in product design, and architects use it for
building design. These plans are a part of organizational memory for
designers and manufacturers.</p>

<h3>Geographic information system<a href="information.html#geographic-information-system" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Many cities uses a geographic information system (GIS) to store
graphical data about roads, utilities, and services. This information is
another form of organizational memory.</p>

<h2>Information integration<a href="information.html#information-integration" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A fundamental problem for most organizations is that their memory is
fragmented across a wide variety of formats and technologies. Sometimes, there is a one-to-one correspondence between an
organizational memory for a particular functional area and the software
delivery system. For example, sales information is delivered by the
sales system and production information by the production system. This
is not a very desirable situation because managers want all the
information they need, regardless of its source or format, amalgamated
into a single report.</p>
<p>A common solution is to develop software, such as a Web application,
that integrates information from a variety of delivery systems. An
important task of this app is to integrate and present information from
multiple organizational memories. Recently, some organizations have
created vast integrated data stores—data warehouses— that are
organized repositories of organizational data.</p>

<div id="knowledge-1" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Knowledge<a href="information.html#knowledge-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The performance of many organizations is determined more by their
cognitive capabilities and knowledge than their physical assets. A
nation’s wealth is increasingly a result of the knowledge and skills of
its citizens (human capital), rather than its natural capital and industrial plants.
Currently, about 85 percent of all jobs in America and 80 percent of
those in Europe are knowledge-based.</p>
<p>An organization’s knowledge, in order of increasing importance, is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>cognitive knowledge (know what);</p></li>
<li><p>advanced skills (know how);</p></li>
<li><p>system understanding and trained intuition (know why);</p></li>
<li><p>self-motivated creativity (care why).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This text illustrates the different types of knowledge. You will develop
cognitive knowledge in Section 4, when you learn about data
architectures and implementations. For example, knowing what storage
devices can be used for archival data is cognitive knowledge. Section 2,
data modeling and SQL, develops advanced skills because, upon completion
of that section, you will know how to model data and write SQL queries.
The first two chapters expand your understanding of the influence of
organizational memory on organizational performance. You need to know
why you should learn data management skills. Managers know when and why
to apply technology, whereas technicians know what to apply and how to
apply it. Finally, you are probably an IS major, and your coursework is
inculcating the values and norms of the IS profession so that you care
why problems are solved using information systems.</p>
<p>Organizations tend to spend more on developing cognitive skills than
they do on fostering creativity. This is, unfortunately, the wrong
priority. Returns are likely to be much greater when higher-level
knowledge skills are developed. Well-managed organizations place more
attention on creating know why and care why skills because they
recognize that knowledge is a key competitive weapon. Furthermore, these
firms have learned that knowledge grows, often very rapidly, when
shared. Knowledge is like a communication network whose potential
benefit grows exponentially as the nodes within the network grow
arithmetically. When knowledge is shared within the organization, or
with customers and suppliers, it multiplies as each person receiving
knowledge imparts it to someone else in the organization or a business
partner.</p>
<p><em>Skills values vs. training expenditures (Quinn et al., 1996)</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%202/knowledge%20and%20training.png" /></p>
<p>There are two types of knowledge: explicit and tacit. Explicit knowledge
is codified and transferable. This textbook is an example of explicit
knowledge. Knowledge about how to design databases has been formalized
and communicated with the intention of transferring it to you, the
reader. Tacit knowledge is personal knowledge, experience, and judgment
that is difficult to codify. It is more difficult to transfer tacit
knowledge because it resides in people’s minds. Usually, the transfer of
tacit knowledge requires the sharing of experiences. In learning to
model data, the subject of the next section, you will quickly learn how
to represent an entity, because this knowledge is made explicit.
However, you will find it much harder to model data, because this skill
comes with practice. Ideally, you should develop several models under
the guidance of an experienced modeler, such as your instructor, who can
pass on their tacit knowledge.</p>

<h3>Summary<a href="information.html#summary-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Information has become a key foundation for organizational growth. The
information society is founded on computer and communications
technology. The accumulation of knowledge requires a capacity to encode
and share information. Hard information is very exact. Soft information
is extremely imprecise. Rich information exchange occurs in face-to-face
conversation. Numeric reports are an example of lean information.
Organizations use information to set goals, determine the gap between
goals and achievements, determine actions to reach goals, and create new
products and services to enhance organizational performance. Managers
depend more on informal communication systems than on formal reporting
systems. They expect to receive information that meets their current,
ever changing needs. Operational managers need short-term information.
Senior executives require mainly long-term information but still have a
need for both short- and medium-term information. When managers face
time constraints, they forced to collect only enough information to make a
satisfactory decision. Organizational memory should be integrated to
provide one interface to an organization’s information stores.</p>

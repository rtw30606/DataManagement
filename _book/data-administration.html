<div id="introduction-3" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Introduction<a href="data-administration.html#introduction-3" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In the information age, data are the lifeblood of every organization and
need to be properly managed to retain their value to the organization.
The importance of data as a key organizational resource has been
emphasized throughout this book. Data administration is the management
of organizational data stores.</p>
<p>Information technology permits organizations to capture, organize, and
maintain a greater variety of data. These data can be hard (e.g.,
financial or production figures) or soft (e.g., management reports,
correspondence, voice conversations, and video). If these data are to be
used in the organization, they must be managed just as diligently as
accounting information. <em>Data administration</em> is the common term applied
to the task of managing organizational memory. Although common, basic
management principles apply to most kinds of organizational data stores,
the discussion in this chapter refers primarily to databases.</p>
<div id="why-manage-data" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Why manage data?<a href="data-administration.html#why-manage-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Data are constantly generated in every act and utterance of every
stakeholder (employee, shareholder, customer, or supplier) in relation
to the organization. Some of these data are formal and structured, such
as invoices, grade sheets, or bank withdrawals. A large amount of
relatively unstructured data is generated too, such as tweets, blogs,
and Facebook comments from customers. Much of the unstructured data
generated within and outside the organizations are frequently captured
but rarely analyzed deeply.</p>
<p>Organization units typically begin maintaining systematic records for
data most likely to impinge on their performance. Often, different
departments or individuals maintain records for the same data. As a
result, the same data may be used in different ways by each department,
and so each of them may adopt a different system of organizing its data.
Over time, an organization accumulates a great deal of redundant data
which demands considerable, needless administrative overhead for its
maintenance. Inconsistencies may begin to emerge between the various
forms of the same data. A department may incorrectly enter some data,
which could result in embarrassment at best or a serious financial loss
for the organization at worst.</p>
<p>When data are fragmented across several departments or individuals, and
especially when there is personnel turnover, data may not be accessible
when most needed. This is nearly as serious a problem as not having any
data. Yet another motivation is that effective data management can
greatly simplify and assist in the identification of new information
system application development opportunities. Also, poor data management
can result in breaches of security. Valuable information may be revealed
to competitors or antagonists.</p>
<p>In summary, the problems arising from poor data management are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same data may be represented through multiple, inconsistent
definitions.</li>
<li>There may be inconsistencies among different representations.</li>
<li>Essential data may be missing from the database.</li>
<li>Data may be inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
<li>Some data may never be captured for the database and thus are
effectively lost to the organization.</li>
<li>There may be no way of knowing how to locate data when they are
needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall goal of data administration is to prevent the occurrence of
these problems by enabling users to access the data they need in the
format most suitable for achieving organizational goals and by ensuring
the integrity of organizational databases.</p>

<div id="the-chief-data-officer" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>The Chief Data Officer<a href="data-administration.html#the-chief-data-officer" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Firms are increasingly recognizing the importance of data to
organizational performance, particularly with the attention given to big
data in the years following 2010. As a result, some have created the new
C-level position of Chief Data Officer (CDO), who is responsible for the
strategic management of data systems and ensuring that the organization
fully seizes data-driven opportunities to create new business, reduce
costs, and increase revenues. The CDO assists the top management team in
gaining full value from data, a key strategic asset.<a href="data-administration.html#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In 2003,
Capital One was perhaps to first firm to appoint a CDO. Other early
creators of this new executive role were Yahoo! and Microsoft Germany.
The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has appointed a CDO for
each of its 11 major divisions. Many firms report plans to create data
stewards and CDOs. Given the strategic nature of data for business, it
is not surprising that one study reports that 30 percent of CDOs report
to the CEO, with another 20% reporting to the COO.</p>
<div id="cdo-role-dimensions" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>CDO role dimensions<a href="data-administration.html#cdo-role-dimensions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Three dimensions of the CDO role have been identified and described (see
the following figure), namely, collaboration direction (inward or
outward), data management focus (traditional transaction or big data,
and value orientation (service or strategy). We now discuss each of
these dimensions.</p>
<p><em>The three dimensions of the CDO role</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2024/cdo.png" /></p>
<div id="inward-vs.-outward-collaboration" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Inward vs. outward collaboration<a href="data-administration.html#inward-vs.-outward-collaboration" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>A CDO can focus collaborative efforts inward or outward. An inward
emphasis might mean working with production to improve the processes for
capturing manufacturing data. An outward oriented CDO, in contrast,
might work with customers to improve the data flow between the firm and
the customer.</p>
<p>Inward oriented initiatives might include developing data quality
assessment methods, establishing data products standards, creating
procedures for managing metadata, and establishing data governance. The
goal is to ensure consistent data delivery and quality inside the
organization.</p>
<p>An outwardly-focused CDO will strive to cooperate with an organization’s
external stakeholders. For example, one CDO led a program for “global
unique product identification” to improve collaboration with external
global partners. Another might pay attention to improving the quality of
data supplied to external partners.</p>
</div>
<div id="traditional-vs.-big-data-management-focus" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Traditional vs. big data management focus<a href="data-administration.html#traditional-vs.-big-data-management-focus" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>A CDO can stress managing traditional transactional data, which is
typically managed with a relational databases, or shift direction
towards handling expanding data volumes with new files structures, such
as Hadoop data file structure (HDFS).</p>
<p>Traditional data are still the foundation of many organization’s
operations, and there remains in many firms a need for a CDO with a
transactional data orientation. Big data promises opportunities for
improving operations or developing new business strategies based on
analyses and insights not available from traditional data. A CDO
attending to big data can provide leadership in helping a business gain
deeper knowledge of its customers, suppliers, and so forth based on
mining large volumes of data.</p>
</div>
<div id="service-vs.-strategy-orientation" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Service vs. strategy orientation<a href="data-administration.html#service-vs.-strategy-orientation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>A CDO can stress improving services or exploring an organization’s
strategic opportunities. This dimension should reflect the
organization’s goals for the CDO position. If the top management team is
mainly concerned with oversight and accountability, then the CDO should
pay attention to improving existing data-related processes.
Alternatively, if the senior team actively seeks new data-driven
strategic value, then the CDO needs to be similarly aligned and might
look at how to exploit digit data streams, for example. One
strategy-directed CDO, for instance, led an initiative to identify new
information products for advancing the firm’s position in the financial
industry.</p>

<div id="cdo-archetypes" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>CDO archetypes<a href="data-administration.html#cdo-archetypes" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Based on the three dimensions just discussed, eight different CDO roles
can be identified, as shown in the following table.</p>
<p><em>Dimensions of CDO archetypes</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2024/cdo-archetypes.png" /></p>
<p>While eight different roles are possible, it is important to note that a
CDO might take on several of these roles as the situation changes and
the position evolves. Also, treat an archetype as a broad indicator of a
role rather than a confining specification.</p>

<h2>Management of the database environment<a href="data-administration.html#management-of-the-database-environment" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In many large organizations, there is a formal data administration
function to manage corporate data. For those companies with a CDO, data
administration might be subsumed within this function. For those without, data
administration is typically the responsibility of the CIO. The
relationship among the various components of data administration is
shown in the following figure.</p>

<div id="databases" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Databases<a href="data-administration.html#databases" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A database management system (DBMS) can manage multiple databases
covering different aspects of an organization’s activities. When a
database has multiple clients, it may be designed to meet all their
requirements, even though a specific person may need only a portion of
the data contained within the database. For instance, a finished-goods
database may be accessed by Production and Finance, as well as
Marketing. It may contain cost information that is accessible by
Production and Finance but not by Marketing.</p>

<div id="system-interface" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>System interface<a href="data-administration.html#system-interface" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The interface consists of windows, menus, icons, and commands that
enable clients to direct the system to manipulate data. Clients may
range from casual novices, who need to be insulated from the underlying
complexity of the data, to expert application developers, who manipulate
the data using programming languages or other data-handling tools.</p>

<div id="data-dictionary" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Data dictionary<a href="data-administration.html#data-dictionary" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A data dictionary is a reference repository containing <em>metadata</em> (<em>data about data</em>) that is stored in the database. Among other things,
the data dictionary contains a list of all the databases; their
component parts and detailed descriptions such as field sizes, data
types, and data validation information for data capture purposes;
authorized clients and their access privileges; and ownership details.</p>
<p>A data dictionary is a map of the data in organizational data stores. It
permits the data administration staff and users to document the
database, design new applications, and redesign the database if
necessary. The data dictionary/directory system (DD/DS), itself a DBMS,
is software for managing the data dictionary.</p>

<div id="external-databases" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>External databases<a href="data-administration.html#external-databases" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>For organizations to remain competitive in a rapidly changing
marketplace, access to data from external sources is becoming
increasingly critical. Research and development groups need access to
the latest developments in their technical fields and need to track
information such as patents filed, research reports, and new product
releases. Marketing departments need access to data on market conditions
and competitive situations as reported in various surveys and the media
in general. Financial data regarding competitors and customers are
important to senior executives. Monitoring political situations may be
critical to many business decisions, especially in the international
business arena.</p>
<p>Extensive external data are available electronically through information
services such as Bloomberg (financial data), Reuters (news), and
LexisNexis (legal data), various government sites,such as data.gov, or
from various Web sites. Tools are available to download external data
into internal databases, from which they may be accessed through the
same interface as for internal data.</p>

<h2>Data administration<a href="data-administration.html#data-administration-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Data administration is responsible for the management of data-related
activities. There are two levels of data administration activities:
system and project.</p>
<p><strong>System-level administration</strong> is concerned with establishing overall
policies and procedures for the management and use of data in the
organization. Formulating a data strategy and specifying an information
architecture for the organization are also system-level data
administration functions.</p>
<p><strong>Project-level administration</strong> deals more with the specifics, such as
optimizing specific databases for operational efficiency, establishing
and implementing database access rights, creating new databases, and
monitoring database use.</p>
<p>In general, the system-level function takes a broader perspective of the
role played by data in achieving business objectives, while the
project-level function is more concerned with the actual mechanics of
database implementation and operation. We use the term <em>data
administration</em> to refer to both functional levels.</p>
<div id="data-administration-functions-and-roles" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Data administration functions and roles<a href="data-administration.html#data-administration-functions-and-roles" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The functions of data administration may be accomplished through
multiple roles or job titles such as database administrator, database
developer, database consultant, and database analyst, collectively
referred to as the data administration staff. A single role could be
responsible for both system and project levels of data administration,
or responsibility may be distributed among several persons, depending on
the size of the organization, the number of database applications, and
the number of clients.</p>
<p>In addition, data administration could be carried out entirely in a
client department. For instance, a client could be the data steward
responsible for managing all corporate data for some critical
business-related entity or activity (e.g., a customer, a production
facility, a supplier, a division, a project, or a product) regardless of
the purpose for which the data are used.</p>
<p><strong>Data stewards</strong> coordinate planning of the data for which they are
responsible. Tasks include data definition, quality control and
improvement, security, and access authorization. The data steward’s role
is especially important today because of the emphasis on customer
satisfaction and cross-functional teams. Data stewardship seeks to align
data management with organizational strategy.</p>
</div>
<div id="database-levels" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Database levels<a href="data-administration.html#database-levels" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Databases may be maintained at several levels of use: personal,
workgroup (e.g., project team or department), and organizational. More
clients usually results in greater complexity of both the database and
its management.</p>
<p>Personal databases in the form of calendars, planners, and name and
address books have existed for a long time. The availability of laptops,
tablets, and smartphones have made it convenient to maintain
synchronized electronic personal databases across multiple devices.
Behind the interface of many of these apps is a lightweight relational
database, such as <a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>.</p>
<p>Workgroup databases cannot be as idiosyncratic because they are shared
by many people. Managing them requires more planning and coordination to
ensure that all the various clients’ needs are addressed and data
integrity is maintained. Organizational databases are the most complex
in terms of both structure and need for administration. All databases,
regardless of scope or level, require administration.</p>
<p>Managing a personal database is relatively simple. Typically, the owner
of the database is also its developer and administrator. Issues such as
access rights and security are settled quite easily, perhaps by locking
the computer when away from the desk. Managing workgroup databases is
more complex. Controls almost certainly will be needed to restrict
access to certain data. On the other hand, some data will need to be
available to many group members. Also, responsibility for backup and
recovery must be established. Small workgroups may jointly perform both
system- and project-level data administration activities. Meetings may
be a way to coordinate system-level data administration activities, and
project-level activities may be distributed among different workgroup
members. Larger groups may have a designated data administrator, who is
also a group member.</p>
<p>Managing organizational databases is typically a full-time job requiring
special skills to work with complex database environments. In large
organizations, several persons may handle data administration, each
carrying out different data administration activities. System-level data
administration activities may be carried out by a committee led by a
senior IS executive (who may be a full- or part-time data
administrator), while project-level data administration activities may
be delegated to individual data administration staff members.</p>

<h4>Planning<a href="data-administration.html#planning-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Because data are a strategic corporate resource, planning is perhaps the
most critical data administration function. A key planning activity is
creating an organization’s information architecture, which includes all
the major data entities and the relationships between them. It indicates
which business functions and applications access which entities. An
information architecture also may address issues such as how data will
be transmitted and where they will be stored. Since an information
architecture is an organization’s overall strategy for data and
applications, it should dovetail with the organization’s long-term plans
and objectives.<a href="data-administration.html#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="developing-data-standards-and-policies" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Developing data standards and policies<a href="data-administration.html#developing-data-standards-and-policies" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Whenever data are used by more than one person, there must be standards
to govern their use. Data standards become especially critical in
organizations using heterogeneous hardware and software environments.
Why could this become a problem? For historical reasons, different
departments may use different names and field sizes for the same data
item. These differences can cause confusion and misunderstanding. For
example, “sale date” may have different meanings for the legal
department (e.g., the date the contract was signed) and the sales
department (e.g., the date of the sales call). Furthermore, the legal
department may store data in the form <em>yyyy-mm-dd</em> and the sales
department as <em>dd-mm-yy</em>. Data administration’s task is to develop and
publish data standards so that field names are clearly defined, and a
field’s size and format are consistent across the enterprise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some data items may be more important to certain
departments or divisions. For instance, customer data are often critical
to the marketing department. It is useful in such cases to appoint a
data steward from the appropriate functional area as custodian for these
data items.</p>
<p>Policies need to be established regarding who can access and manipulate
which data, when, and from where. For instance, should employees using
their home computers be allowed to access corporate data? If such access
is permitted, then data security and risk exposure must be considered
and adequate data safeguards implemented.</p>

<div id="defining-xml-data-schemas" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Defining XML data schemas<a href="data-administration.html#defining-xml-data-schemas" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Data administration is also often responsible for defining data schemas
for data exchange within the organization and among business partners.
Data administration is also responsible for keeping abreast of industry
schema standards so that the organization is in conformance with common
practice. Some data administrators may even work on defining a common
data schema for an industry.</p>

<div id="resolving-data-conflict" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Resolving data conflict<a href="data-administration.html#resolving-data-conflict" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Data administration involves the custodianship of data <em>owned</em> or
originating in various organizational departments or functions, and
conflicts are bound to arise at some point. For instance, one department
may be concerned about a loss of security when another department is
allowed access to its data. In another instance, one group may feel that
another is contaminating a commonly used data pool because of inadequate
data validation practices. Incidents like these, and many others,
require management intervention and settlement through a formal or
informal process of discussion and negotiation in which all parties are
assured of an outcome that best meets the needs of the organization.
Data administration facilitates negotiation and mediates dispute
resolution.</p>

<div id="managing-the-dbms" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Managing the DBMS<a href="data-administration.html#managing-the-dbms" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>While project-level data administration is concerned more directly with
the DBMS, the performance and characteristics of the DBMS ultimately
impinge on the effectiveness of the system-level data administration
function. It is, therefore, important to monitor characteristics of the
DBMS. Over a period, benchmark statistics for different projects or
applications will need to be compiled. These statistics are especially
useful for addressing complaints regarding the performance of the DBMS,
which may then lead to design changes, tuning of the DBMS, or additional
hardware.</p>
<p>Database technology is rapidly advancing. For example, relational DBMSs
are continually being extended, and Hadoop offers a new approach to
handle large data processing tasks. Keeping track of developments,
evaluating their benefits, and deciding on converting to new database
environments are critical system-level data administration functions
that can have strategic implications for the corporation.</p>

<div id="establishing-and-maintaining-the-data-dictionary" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Establishing and maintaining the data dictionary<a href="data-administration.html#establishing-and-maintaining-the-data-dictionary" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>A data dictionary is a key data administration tool that provides
details of data in the organizational database and how they are used
(e.g., by various application programs). If modifications are planned
for the database (e.g., changing the size of a column in a table), the
data dictionary helps to determine which applications will be affected
by the proposed changes.</p>
<p>More sophisticated data dictionary systems are closely integrated with
specific database products. They are updated automatically whenever the
structure of the underlying database is changed.</p>
</div>
<div id="selecting-hardware-and-software" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Selecting hardware and software<a href="data-administration.html#selecting-hardware-and-software" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Evaluating and selecting the appropriate hardware and software for an
organizational database are critical responsibilities with strategic
organizational implications. These are not easy tasks because of the
dynamic nature of the database industry, the continually changing
variety of available hardware and software products, and the rapid pace
of change within many organizations. Today’s excellent choice might
become tomorrow’s nightmare if, for instance, the vendor of a key
database component goes out of business or ceases product development.</p>
<p>Extensive experience and knowledge of the database software business and
technological progress in the field are essential to making effective
database hardware and software decisions. The current and future needs
of the organization need to be assessed in terms of capacity as well as
features. Relevant questions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many people and apps will simultaneously access the database?</li>
<li>Will the database need to be geographically distributed? If so, what
is the degree to which the database will be replicated, and what is
the nature of database replication that is supported?</li>
<li>What is the maximum size of the database?</li>
<li>How many transactions per second can the DBMS handle?</li>
<li>What kind of support for online transaction processing is available?</li>
<li>What are the initial and ongoing costs of using the product?</li>
<li>Can the database be extended to include new data types?</li>
<li>What is the extent of training required, who can provide it, and
what are the associated costs?</li>
</ul>
<p>DBMS selection should cover technical, operational, and financial
considerations. An organization’s selection criteria are often specified
in a request for proposal (RFP). This document is sent to a short list
of potential vendors, who are invited to respond with a software or
hardware/software proposal outlining how their product or service meets
each criterion in the RFP. Discussions with current customers are
usually desirable to gain confirming evidence of a vendor’s claims. The
final decision should be based on the manner and degree to which each
vendor’s proposal satisfies these criteria.</p>

<p>A small nonprofit organization has asked for your help
in selecting a relational database management system (RDBMS) for
general-purpose management tasks. Because of budget limitations, it is

least two open source RDBMSs, compare the two systems, and make a
recommendation to the organization.</p>

<div id="benchmarking-1" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Benchmarking<a href="data-administration.html#benchmarking-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Benchmarking, the comparison of alternative hardware and software
combinations, is an important step in the selection phase. Because
benchmarking is an activity performed by many IS units, the IS community
gains if there is one group that specializes in rigorous benchmarking of
a wide range of systems. The <a href="http://www.tpc.org">Transaction Processing Council</a> (TPC) is the IS profession’s Consumer Union. TPC has established benchmarks for a variety of business situations.</p>
</div>
<div id="managing-external-databases" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Managing external databases<a href="data-administration.html#managing-external-databases" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Providing access to external databases has increased the level of
complexity of data administration, which now has the additional
responsibility of identifying information services that meet existing or
potential managerial needs. Data administration must determine the
quality of such data and the means by which they can be channeled into
the organization’s existing information delivery system. Costs of data
may vary among vendors. Some may charge a flat monthly or annual fee,
while others may have a usage charge. Data may arrive in a variety of
formats, and data administration may need to make them adhere to
corporate standards. Data from different vendors and sources may need to
be integrated and presented in a unified format and on common screens.</p>
<p>Monitoring external data sources is critical because data quality may
vary over time. Data administration must determine whether
organizational needs are continuing to be met and data quality is being
maintained. If they are not, a subscription may be canceled and an
alternative vendor sought. Security is another critical problem. When
corporate databases are connected to external communication links, there
is a threat of hackers breaking into the system and gaining unauthorized
access to confidential internal data. Also, corporate data may be
contaminated by spurious data or even by viruses entering from external
sources. Data administration must be cautious when incorporating
external data into the database.</p>

<div id="internal-marketing" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Internal marketing<a href="data-administration.html#internal-marketing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Because IS applications can have a major impact on organizational
performance, the IS function is becoming more proactive in initiating
the development of new applications. Many clients are not aware of what
is possible with newly emergent technologies, and hence do not see
opportunities to exploit these developments. Also, as custodian of
organizational data, data administration needs to communicate its goals
and responsibilities throughout the organization. People and departments
need to be persuaded to share data that may be of value to other parts
of the organization. There may be resistance to change when people are
asked to switch to newly set data standards. In all these instances,
data administration must be presented in a positive light to lessen
resistance to change. Data administration needs to market internally its
products and services to its customers.</p>

<p>Database development follows a fairly predictable sequence of steps or

<p>Application development involves the eight phases shown in the preceding
table. It commences with project planning which, among other things,
involves determining project feasibility and allocating the necessary
personnel and material resources for the project. This is followed by
requirements definition, which involves considerable interaction with
clients to clearly specify the system. These specifications become the
basis for a conceptual application design, which is then constructed
through program coding and tested. Once the system is thoroughly tested,
it is installed and user operations begin. Over time, changes may be
needed to upgrade or repair the system, and this is called system
maintenance.</p>
<p>The database development phases parallel application development. Data
administration is responsible for the DDLC. Data are the focus of
database development, rather than procedures or processes. Database
construction is folded into the testing phase because database testing
typically involves minimal effort. In systems with integrated data
dictionaries, the process of constructing the data dictionary also
creates the database shell (i.e., tables without data). While the
sequence of phases in the cycle as presented is generally followed,
there is often a number of iterations within and between steps. Data
modeling is iterative, and the final database design evolves from many
data modeling sessions. A previously unforeseen requirement may surface
during the database design phase, and this may prompt a revision of the
specifications completed in the earlier phase.</p>
<p>System development may proceed in three different ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The database may be developed independently of applications,
following only the DDLC steps.</li>
<li>Applications may be developed for existing databases, following only
the ADLC steps.</li>
<li>Application and database development may proceed in parallel, with
both simultaneously stepping through the ADLC and DDLC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider each of these possibilities.</p>
<p>Database development may proceed independently of application
development for a number of reasons. The database may be created and
later used by an application or for ad hoc queries using SQL. In another
case, an existing database may undergo changes to meet changed business
requirements. In such situations, the developer goes through the
appropriate stages of the DDLC.</p>
<p>Application development may proceed based on an existing database. For
instance, a personnel database may already exist to serve a set of
applications, such as payroll. This database could be used as the basis
for a new personnel benefits application, which must go through all the
phases of the ADLC.</p>
<p>A new system requires both application and database development.
Frequently, a new system will require creation of both a new database
and applications. For instance, a computer manufacturer may start a new
Web-based order sales division and wish to monitor its performance. The
vice-president in charge of the division may be interested in receiving
daily sales reports by product and by customer as well as a weekly
moving sales trend analysis for the prior 10 weeks. This requires both
the development of a new sales database as well as a new application for
sales reporting. Here, the ADLC and DDLC are both used to manage
development of the new system.</p>

</table>
<p>The database developer shoulders the bulk of the responsibility for
developing data models and implementing the database. This can be seen
in the table, where most of the cells in the database developer column
are labeled “Does.” The database developer does project planning,
requirements definition, database design, database testing, and database
implementation, and in addition, is responsible for database evolution.</p>
<p>The client’s role is to establish the goals of a specific database
project, provide the database developers with access to all information
needed for project development, and review and regularly scrutinize the
developer’s work.</p>
<p>The data administrator’s prime responsibilities are implementing and
controlling, but the person also may be required to perform activities
and consult. In some situations, the database developer is not part of
the data administration staff and may be located in a client department,
or may be an analyst from an IS project team. In these cases, the data
administrator advises the developer on organizational standards and
policies as well as provides specific technical guidelines for
successful construction of a database. When the database developer is
part of the data administration staff, developer and data administration
activities may be carried out by the same person, or by the person(s)
occupying the data administration role. In all cases, the data
administrator should understand the larger business context in which the
database will be used and should be able to relate business needs to
specific technical capabilities and requirements.</p>

<h4>Database development life cycle (DDLC)<a href="data-administration.html#database-development-life-cycle-ddlc" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Previously, we discussed the various roles involved in database
development and how they may be assigned to different persons. In this
section, we will assume that administration and development are carried
out by the data administration staff, since this is the typical
situation encountered in many organizations. The activities of developer

<div id="database-project-planning" class="section level5 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h5>Database project planning<a href="data-administration.html#database-project-planning" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>Database project planning includes establishing project goals,
determining project feasibility (financial, technical, and operational),
creating an implementation plan and schedule, assigning project
responsibilities (including data stewards), and establishing standards.
All project stakeholders, including clients, senior management, and
developers, are involved in planning. They are included for their
knowledge as well as to gain their commitment to the project.</p>
</div>
<div id="requirements-definition" class="section level5 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h5>Requirements definition<a href="data-administration.html#requirements-definition" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>During requirements definition, clients and developers establish
requirements and develop a mutual understanding of what the new system
will deliver. Data are defined and the resulting definitions stored in
the data dictionary. Requirements definition generates documentation
that should serve as an unambiguous reference for database development.
Although in theory the clients are expected to <em>sign-off</em> on the
specifications and accept the developed database as is, their needs may
actually change in practice. Clients may gain a greater understanding of
their requirements and business conditions may change. Consequently, the
original specifications may require revision. In the preceding figure,
the arrows connecting phase 4 (testing) and phase 3 (design) to phase 2
(requirements definition) indicate that modeling and testing may
identify revisions to the database specification, and these amendments
are then incorporated into the design.</p>
</div>
<div id="database-design" class="section level5 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h5>Database design<a href="data-administration.html#database-design" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>Conceptual and internal models of the database are developed during
database design. Conceptual design, or data modeling, is discussed
extensively in Section 2 of this book. Database design should also
include specification of procedures for testing the database. Any
additional controls for ensuring data integrity are also specified. The
external model should be checked and validated by the user.</p>
</div>
<div id="database-testing" class="section level5 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h5>Database testing<a href="data-administration.html#database-testing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>Database testing requires previously developed specifications and models
to be tested using the intended DBMS. Clients are often asked to provide
operational data to support testing the database with realistic
transactions. Testing should address a number of key questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the DBMS support all the operational and security requirements?</li>
<li>Is the system able to handle the expected number of transactions per
second?</li>
<li>How long does it take to process a realistic mix of queries?</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing assists in making early decisions regarding the suitability of
the selected DBMS. Another critical aspect of database testing is
verifying data integrity controls. Testing may include checking backup
and recovery procedures, access control, and data validation rules.</p>
</div>
<div id="database-implementation" class="section level5 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h5>Database implementation<a href="data-administration.html#database-implementation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>Testing is complete when the clients and developers are extremely
confident the system meets specified needs. Data integrity controls are
implemented, operational data are loaded (including historical data, if
necessary), and database documentation is finalized. Clients are then
trained to operate the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="database-use" class="section level5 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h5>Database use<a href="data-administration.html#database-use" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>Clients may need considerable support as they learn and adapt to the
system. Monitoring database performance is critical to keeping them
satisfied; enables the data administrator to anticipate problems even
before the clients begin to notice and complain about them, and tune the
system to meet organizational needs; and also helps to enforce data
standards and policies during the initial stages of database
implementation.</p>
</div>
<div id="database-evolution" class="section level5 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h5>Database evolution<a href="data-administration.html#database-evolution" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>Since organizations cannot afford to stand still in today’s dynamic
business environment, business needs are bound to change over time,
perhaps even after a few months. Data administration should be prepared
to meet the challenge of change. Minor changes, such as changes in
display formats, or performance improvements, may be continually
requested. These have to be attended to on an ongoing basis. Other
evolutionary changes may emerge from constant monitoring of database use
by the data administration staff. Implementing these evolutionary
changes involves repeating phases 3 to 6. Significant business changes
may merit a radical redesign of the database. Major redesign may require
repeating all phases of the DDLC.</p>

<div id="data-administration-interfaces" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Data administration interfaces<a href="data-administration.html#data-administration-interfaces" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Data administration is increasingly a key corporate function, and it
requires the existence of established channels of communication with
various organizational groups. The key data administration interfaces
are with clients, management, development staff, and computer
operations. The central position of the data administration staff, shown
in the following figure, reflects the liaison role that it plays in
managing databases. Each of the groups has a different focus and
different terminology and jargon. Data administration should be able to
communicate effectively with all participants. For instance, operations
staff will tend to focus on technical, day-to-day issues to which
management is likely to pay less attention. These different focuses can,
and frequently do, lead to conflicting views and expectations among the
different groups. Good interpersonal skills are a must for data
administration staff in order to deal with a variety of conflict-laden
situations. Data administration, therefore, needs a balance of people,
technical, and business skills for effective execution of its tasks.</p>
<p><em>Major data administration interfaces</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2024/data-interfaces.png" /></p>
<p>Data administration probably will communicate most frequently with
computer operations and development staff, somewhat less frequently with
clients, and least frequently with management. These differences,
however, have little to do with the relative importance of communicating
with each group. The interactions between the data administration staff
and each of the four groups are discussed next.</p>
<div id="management" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Management<a href="data-administration.html#management" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Management sets the overall business agenda for data administration,
which must ensure that its actions directly contribute to the
achievement of organizational goals. In particular, management
establishes overall policy guidelines, approves data administration
budgets, evaluates proposals, and champions major changes. For instance,
if the data administration staff is interested in introducing new
technology, management may request a formal report on the anticipated
benefits of the proposed expenditure.</p>
<p>Interactions between the data administration staff and management may
focus on establishing and evolving the information architecture for the
organization. In some instances, these changes may involve the
introduction of a new technology that could fundamentally transform
roles or the organization.</p>
</div>
<div id="clients" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Clients<a href="data-administration.html#clients" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>On an ongoing basis, most clients will be less concerned with
architectural issues and will focus on their personal needs. Data
administration must determine what data should be collected and stored,
how they should be validated to ensure integrity, and in what form and
frequency they should be made available.</p>
<p>Typically, the data administration staff is responsible for managing the
database, while the data supplier is responsible for ensuring accuracy.
This may cause conflict, however, if there are multiple clients from
separate departments. If conflict does arise, data administration has to
arbitrate.</p>
</div>
<div id="development-staff" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Development staff<a href="data-administration.html#development-staff" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Having received strategic directions from management, and after
determining clients’ needs, data administration works with application
and database developers, in order to fulfill the organization’s goals
for the new system. On an ongoing basis, this may consist of developing
specifications for implementation. Data administration works on an
advisory basis with systems development, providing inputs on the
database aspects. Data administration is typically responsible for
establishing standards for program and database interfaces and making
developers aware of these standards. Developers may need to be told
which commands may be used in their programs and which databases they
can access.</p>
<p>In many organizations, database development is part of data
administration, and it has a very direct role in database design and
implementation. In such instances, communication between data
administration and database development is within the group. In other
organizations, database development is not part of data administration,
and communication is between groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="computer-operations" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Computer operations<a href="data-administration.html#computer-operations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The focus of computer operations is on the physical hardware,
procedures, schedules and shifts, staff assignments, physical security
of data, and execution of programs. Data administration responsibilities
include establishing and monitoring procedures for operating the
database. The data administration staff needs to establish and
communicate database backup, recovery, and archiving procedures to
computer operations. Also, the scheduling of new database and
application installations needs to be coordinated with computer
operations personnel.</p>
<p>Computer operations provide data administration with operational
statistics and exception reports. These data are used by data
administration to ensure that corporate database objectives are being
fulfilled.</p>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Communication<a href="data-administration.html#communication" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The diverse parties with which data administration communicates often
see things differently. This can lead to misunderstandings and results
in systems that fail to meet requirements. Part of the problem arises
from a difference in perspective and approaches to viewing database
technology.</p>
<p>Management is interested in understanding how implementing database
technology will contribute to strategic goals. In contrast, clients are
interested in how the proposed database and accompanying applications
will affect their daily work. Developers are concerned with translating
management and client needs into conceptual models and converting these
into tables and applications. Operations staff are concerned primarily
with efficient daily management of DBMS, computer hardware, and
software.</p>
<p>Data models can serve as a common language for bridging the varying
goals of clients, developers, management, and operational staff. A data
model can reduce the ambiguity inherent in verbal communications and
thereby ensure that overall needs are more closely met and all parties
are satisfied with the results. A data model provides a common meeting
point and language for understanding the needs of each group.</p>
<p>Data administration does not work in isolation. It must communicate
successfully with all its constituents in order to be successful. The
capacity to understand and correctly translate the needs of each
stakeholder group is the key to competent data administration.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-administration-tools" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Data administration tools<a href="data-administration.html#data-administration-tools" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Several computer-based tools have emerged to support data
administration. There are five major classes of tools: data dictionary,
DBMS, performance monitoring, computer-aided software engineering
(CASE), and groupware tools. Each of these tools is now examined and its
role in supporting data administration considered. We focus on how these
tools support the DDLC. Note, however, that groupware is not shown in
the following table because it is useful in all phases of the life
cycle.</p>

<p>Data administration staff, clients, and computer operations all require
information about organizational databases. Ideally, such information
should be stored in one central repository. This is the role of the
DD/DS, perhaps the main data administration tool. Thus, we start our
discussion with this tool.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-dictionarydirectory-system-ddds" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Data dictionary/directory system (DD/DS)<a href="data-administration.html#data-dictionarydirectory-system-ddds" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The DD/DS, a database application that manages the data dictionary, is
an essential tool for data administration. The DD/DS is the repository
for organizational metadata, such as data definitions, relationships,
and privileges. The DBMS manages data, and the DD/DS manages data about
data. The DD/DS also uses the data dictionary to generate table
definitions or schema required by the DBMS and application programs to
access databases.</p>
<p>Clients and data administration can utilize the DD/DS to ask questions
about characteristics of data stored in organizational databases such as</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the names of all tables for which the user Todd has delete
privileges?</li>
<li>Where does the data item <em>customer number</em> appear or where is it
used?</li>
</ul>
<p>The report for the second query could include the names and tables,
transactions, reports, display screens, account names, and application
programs.</p>
<p>In some systems, such as a relational DBMS, the catalog, discussed in
the SQL chapter, performs some of the functions of a DD/DS, although the
catalog does not contain the same level of detail. The catalog
essentially contains data about tables, columns, and owners of tables,
whereas the DD/DS can include data about applications, forms,
transactions, and many other aspects of the system. Consequently, a
DD/DS is of greater value to data administration.</p>
<p>Although there is no standard format for data stored in a data
dictionary, several features are common across systems. For example, a
data dictionary for a typical relational database environment would
contain descriptions of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All columns that are defined in all tables of all databases. The
data dictionary stores specific data characteristics such as name,
data type, display format, internal storage format, validation
rules, and integrity constraints. It indicates to which table a
column belongs.</li>
<li>All relationships among data elements, what elements are involved,
and characteristics of relationships, such as cardinality and
degree.</li>
<li>All defined databases, including who created each database, the date
of creation, and where the database is located.</li>
<li>All tables defined in all databases. The data dictionary is likely
to store details of who created the table, the date of creation,
primary key, and the number of columns.</li>
<li>All indexes defined for each of the database tables. For each of the
indexes, the DBMS stores data such as the index name, location,
specific index characteristics, and creation date.</li>
<li>All clients and their access authorizations for various databases.</li>
<li>All programs that access the database, including screen formats,
report formats, application programs, and SQL queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>A data dictionary can be useful for both systems and project level data
administration activities. The five major uses of a data dictionary are
the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Documentation support: recording, classifying, and reporting
metadata.</li>
<li>Data maps: a map of available data for data administration staff and
users. A data map allows users to discover what data exist, what
they mean, where they are stored, and how they are accessed.</li>
<li>Design aid: documenting the relationships between data entities and
performing impact analysis.</li>
<li>Schema generation: automatic generation of data definition
statements needed by software systems such as the DBMS and
application programs.</li>
<li>Change control: setting and enforcing standards, evaluating the
impact of proposed changes, and implementing amendments, such as
adding new data items.</li>
</ol>

<div id="database-management-systems-dbmss" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Database management systems (DBMSs)<a href="data-administration.html#database-management-systems-dbmss" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The DBMS is the primary tool for maintaining database integrity and
making data available to users. Availability means making data
accessible to whoever needs them, when and where they need them, and in
a meaningful form. Maintaining database integrity implies the
implementation of control procedures to achieve the three goals
discussed in a prior chapter: protecting existence, maintaining quality,
and ensuring confidentiality. In terms of the DDLC life cycle (see the
following figure), data administration uses, or helps others to use, the
DBMS to create and test new databases, define data integrity controls,
modify existing database definitions, and provide tools for clients to
retrieve and update databases. Since much of this book has been devoted
to DBMS functions, we limit our discussion to reviewing its role as a
data administration tool.</p>
<div id="performance-monitoring-tools" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Performance monitoring tools<a href="data-administration.html#performance-monitoring-tools" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Monitoring the performance of DBMS and database operations by gathering
usage statistics is essential to improving performance, enhancing
availability, and promoting database evolution. Monitoring tools are
used to collect statistics and improve database performance during the
implementation and use stages of the DDLC. Monitoring tools can also be
used to collect data to evaluate design choices during testing.</p>
<p>Many database factors can be monitored and a variety of statistics
gathered. Monitoring growth in the number of rows in each table can
reveal trends that are helpful in projecting future needs for physical
storage space. Database access patterns can be scrutinized to record
data such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of function requested: query, insert, update, or delete</li>
<li>Response time (elapsed time from query to response)</li>
<li>Number of disk accesses</li>
<li>Identification of client</li>
<li>Identification of error conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The observed patterns help to determine performance enhancements. For
example, these statistics could be used to determine which tables or
files should be indexed. Since gathering statistics can result in some
degradation of overall performance, it should be possible to turn the
monitoring function on or off with regard to selected statistics.</p>
</div>
<div id="case-tools" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>CASE tools<a href="data-administration.html#case-tools" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A CASE tool, as broadly defined, provides automated assistance for
systems development, maintenance, and project management activities.
Data administration may use project management tools to coordinate all
phases within the DDLC. The dictionary provided by CASE systems can be
used to supplement the DD/DS, especially where the database development
effort is part of a systems development project.</p>
<p>One of the most important components of a CASE tool is an extensive
dictionary that tracks all objects created by systems designers.
Database and application developers can use the CASE dictionary to store
descriptions of data elements, application processes, screens, reports,
and other relevant information. Thus, during the first three phases of
the life cycle, the CASE dictionary performs functions similar to a
DD/DS. During stages 4 and 5, data from the CASE dictionary would be
transferred, usually automatically, to the DD/DS.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="groupware-1" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Groupware<a href="data-administration.html#groupware-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Groupware can be applied by data administration to support any of the
DDLC phases shown in the figure. Groupware supports communication among
people and thus enhances access to organizational memory residing within
humans. As pointed out, data administration interfaces with four major
groups during the DDLC: management, clients, developers, and computer
operations. Groupware supports interactions with all of these groups.</p>
<p>Data administration is a complex task involving a variety of
technologies and the need to interact with, and satisfy the needs of, a
diverse range of clients. Managing such a complex environment demands
the use of computer-based tools, which make data administration more
manageable and effective. Software tools, such as CASE and groupware,
can improve data administration.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-integration" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Data integration<a href="data-administration.html#data-integration" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A common problem for many organizations is a lack of data integration,
which can manifest in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different identifiers for the same instance of an entity (e.g., the
same product with different codes in different divisions)</li>
<li>The same, or what should be the same, data stored in multiple
systems (e.g., a customer’s name and address)</li>
<li>Data for, or related to, a key entity stored in different databases
(e.g., a customer’s transaction history and profile stored in
different databases)</li>
<li>Different rules for computing the same business indicator (e.g., the
Australian office computes net profit differently from the U.S.
office)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following table, we see an example of a firm that practices data
integration. Different divisions use the same numbers for parts, the
same identifiers for customers, and have a common definition of sales
date. In contrast, the table after that shows the case of a firm where
there is a lack of data integration. The different divisions have
different identifiers for the same part and different codes for the same
customer, as well as different definitions for the sales date. Imagine
the problems this nonintegrated firm would have in trying to determine
how much it sold to each of its customers in the last six months.</p>

<p>Complete the data integration lab exercise described
on the book’s Web site (Lab exercises &gt; Data integration).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly, many organizations seek to increase their degree of
data integration so that they can improve the accuracy of managerial
reporting, reduce the cost of managing data, and improve customer
service by having a single view of the customer.</p>
<p>There are several goals of data integration:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A standard meaning for all data elements within the organization
(e.g., customer acquisition date is the date on which the customer
first purchased a product)</li>
<li>A standard format for each and every data element (e.g., all dates
are stored in the format yyyymmdd and reported in the format
yyyy-mm-dd)</li>
<li>A standard coding system (e.g., female is coded “f” and male is
coded “m”)</li>
<li>A standard measurement system (e.g., all measurements are stored in
metric format and reported in the client’s preferred system)</li>
<li>A single corporate data model, or a least a single data model for
each major business entity</li>
</ol>
<p>These are challenging goals for many organizations and sometimes take
years to achieve. Many organizations are still striving to achieve the
fifth, and most difficult, goal of a single corporate data model.
Sometimes, however, data integration might not be a goal worth pursuing
if the costs outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>The two major factors that determine the desirable degree of data
integration between organizational units are unit interdependence and
environmental turbulence. There is a high level of interdependence
between organizational units when they affect each other’s success (for
example, the output of one unit is used by the other). As a result of
the commonality of some of their goals, these units will gain from
sharing standardized information. Data integration will make it easier
for them to coordinate their activities and manage their operations.
Essentially, data integration means that they will speak a common
information language. When there is low interdependence between two
organizational units, the gains from data integration are usually
outweighed by the bureaucratic costs and delays of trying to enforce
standards. If two units have different approaches to marketing and
manufacturing, then a high level of data integration is unlikely to be
beneficial. They gain little from sharing data because they have so
little in common.</p>
<p>When organizational units operate in highly turbulent environments, they
need flexibility to be able to handle rapid change. They will often need
to change their information systems quickly to respond to new
competitive challenges. Forcing such units to comply with organizational
data integration standards will slow down their ability to create new
systems and thus threaten their ability to respond in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Firms have three basic data integration strategies based on the level of
organizational unit interdependence and environmental turbulence. When
unit interdependence is low and environmental turbulence high, a unit
should settle for a low level of data integration, such as common
financial reporting and human resources systems. Moderate data
integration might mean going beyond the standard financial reporting and
human resources system to include a common customer database. If unit
independence is high and turbulence high, then moderate data integration
would further extend to those areas where the units overlap (e.g., if
they share a manufacturing system, this would be a target for data
integration). A high level of data integration, a desirable target when
unit interdependence is high and environmental turbulence low, means
targeting common systems for both units.</p>

<h2>Conclusion<a href="data-administration.html#conclusion-9" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Data administration has become increasingly important for most
organizations, particularly for those for whom data-driven decision
making can significantly enhance performance. The emergence of the Chief
Data Officer is a strong indicator of the growing impact of data on the
ability of an organization to fulfill its mission. For many
organizations, it is no longer sufficient to just focus on administering
data. Rather, it is now critical for many to insert to insert data
management and exploitation into the strategic thinking of the top
management team.</p>
<div id="summary-24" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Summary<a href="data-administration.html#summary-24" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Companies are finding that data management is so critical to their
future that they need a Chief Data Officer (CDO). Eight different types
of CDO roles have been identified: coordinator, reporter, architect,
ambassador, analyst, marketer, developer, and experimenter. In practice,
a CDO is likely to shift among these roles depending on the enterprise’s
needs.</p>
<p>Data administration is the task of managing that part of organizational
memory that involves electronically available data. Managing electronic
data stores is important because key organizational decisions are based
on data drawn from them, and it is necessary to ensure that reliable
data are available when needed. Data administration is carried out at
both the system level, which involves overall policies and alignment
with organizational goals, and the project level, where the specific
details of each database are handled. Key modules in data administration
are the DBMS, the DD/DS, user interfaces, and external databases.</p>
<p>Data administration is a function performed by those with assigned
organizational roles. Data administration may be carried out by a
variety of persons either within the IS department or in user
departments. Also, this function may occur at the personal, workgroup,
or organizational level.</p>
<p>Data administration involves communication with management, clients,
developers, and computer operations staff. It needs the cooperation of
all four groups to perform its functions effectively. Since each group
may hold very different perspectives, which could lead to conflicts and
misunderstandings, it is important for data administration staff to
possess superior communication skills. Successful data administration
requires a combination of interpersonal, technical, and business skills.</p>
<p>Data administration is complex, and its success partly depends on a
range of computer-based tools. Available tools include DD/DS, DBMS,
performance monitoring tools, CASE tools, and groupware.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Why do organizations need to manage data?</p></li>
<li><p>What problems can arise because of poor data administration?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the purpose of a data dictionary?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think a data dictionary should be part of a DBMS or a
separate package?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the management of external databases differ from internal
databases?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between system- and project-level data
administration?</p></li>

databases? What are the implications for data administration?</p></li>
<li><p>What is an information architecture?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do organizations need data standards? Give some examples of
typical data items that may require standardization.</p></li>
<li><p>You have been asked to advise a firm on the capacity of its database
system. Describe the procedures you would use to estimate the size
of the database and the number of transactions per second it will
have to handle.</p></li>
<li><p>Why would a company issue an RFP?</p></li>
<li><p>How do the roles of database developer and data administrator
differ?</p></li>

autonomy. How would you recommend the corporation establish its data
administration function?</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the personality of a successful data administration
manager. Compare your assessment to the personality appropriate for
a database technical adviser.</p></li>

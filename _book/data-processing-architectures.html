<div id="architectural-choices" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Architectural choices<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#architectural-choices" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In general terms, data can be stored and processed locally or remotely.
Combinations of these two options provide the basic information systems
architectures.</p>
<p><em>Basic architectures</em></p>

</div>
<div id="remote-job-entry" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Remote job entry<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#remote-job-entry" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In remote job entry, data are stored locally and processed remotely.
Data are sent over a network to a remote computer cluster for processing, and
the output is returned the same way. Remote job entry can
overcome speed or memory shortcomings of a personal computer. Scientists
and engineers typically need occasional access to a supercomputer for
applications, such as simulating global climate change, that are data or
computational intensive. Clusters typically have the main memory
and processing power to handle such problems.</p>
<p>Local storage is used for several reasons. <em>First</em>, it may be cheaper
than storing on a cluster. <em>Second</em>, the analyst might be able to
do some local processing and preparation of the data before sending them
to the cluster. Cluster time can be expensive. Where
possible, local processing is used for tasks such as data entry,
validation, and reporting. <em>Third</em>, local data storage might be deemed
more secure for particularly sensitive data.</p>
</div>
<div id="personal-database" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Personal database<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#personal-database" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>People can store and process their data locally when they have their own
computers. Many personal computer database systems (e.g., MS Access and
FileMaker) permit people to develop their own applications, and many
common desktop applications require local database facilities (e.g., a
calendar).</p>
<p>Of course, there is a downside to personal databases. <em>First</em>, there
is a great danger of repetition and redundancy. The same application
might be developed in a slightly different way by many people. The same
data get stored on many different systems. (It is not always the same,
however, because data entry errors or maintenance inconsistencies result
in discrepancies between personal databases.) <em>Second</em>, data are not
readily shared because people are not always aware of what is available
or find it inconvenient to share data. Personal databases are exactly
that; but much of the data may be of corporate value and should be
shared. <em>Third</em>, data integrity procedures are often quite lax for
personal databases. People might not make regular backups, databases are
often not secured from unauthorized access, and data validation
procedures are often ignored. <em>Fourth</em>, often when an employee leaves
the organization or moves to another role, the application and data are
lost because they are not documented and the organization is unaware of
their existence. <em>Fifth</em>, most personal databases are poorly designed
and, in many cases, people use a spreadsheet as a poor substitute for a
database. Personal databases are clearly very important for many
organizations—when used appropriately. Data that are shared require a
different processing architecture.</p>
</div>
<div id="clientserver" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Client/server<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#clientserver" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The client/server architecture, in which multiple computers interact in
a superior and subordinate mode, is the dominant architecture these
days. A client process initiates a request and a server responds. The
client is the dominant partner because it initiates the request to which
the server responds. Client and server processes can run on the same
computer, but generally they run on separate, linked computers. In the
three-tier client/server model, the application and database are on
separate servers.</p>
<p>A generic client/server architecture consists of several key components.
It usually includes a mix of operating systems, data communications
managers (usually abbreviated to DC manager), applications, clients
(e.g., browser), and database management systems. The DC manager handles
the transfer of data between clients and servers.</p>
<p><em>Three-tier client/server computing</em></p>
<p><img src="Figures/Chapter%2021/three-tier-computing.png" /></p>
<p>The three-tier model consists of three types of systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Clients</strong> perform presentation functions, manage the graphical
user interface (GUI), and execute communication software that
provides network access. In most cases, the client is an Internet
browser, though sometimes there might be a special program, a thin
client, running on the client machine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application servers</strong> are where the majority of the business and
data logic are processed. They process commands sent by clients.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data servers</strong> run a DBMS. They respond to requests from an
application, in which case the application is a client. They will
also typically provide backup and recovery services and transaction
management control.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Under the three-tier model, the client requests a service from an
application server, and the application server requests data from a data
server. The computing environment is a complex array of clients,
application servers, and data servers. An organization can spread its
processing load across many servers. This enables it to scale up the
data processing workload more easily. For example, if a server running
several applications is overloaded, another server can be purchased and
some of the workload moved to the new server.</p>
<p>The client/server concept has evolved to describe a widely distributed,
data-rich, cooperative environment. This is known as the n-tier
client/server environment, which can consist of collections of servers
dedicated to applications, data, transaction management, systems
management, and other tasks. It extends the database side to incorporate
nonrelational systems, such as multidimensional databases, multimedia
databases, and legacy systems.</p>

</table>
<p>The rise of n-tier client/server can be attributed to the benefits of
adopting a component-based architecture. The goal is to build quickly
scalable systems by plugging together existing components. On the client
side, the Web browser is a readily available component that makes
deployment of new systems very simple. When everyone in the corporation
has a browser installed on their personal computer, rolling out a new
application is just a case of e-mailing the URL to the people concerned.
Furthermore, the flexibility of the client/server model means that
smartphones and tablets can easily be incorporated into the system.
Thus, the client can be an app on an iPad.</p>
<p>On the data server side, many data management systems already exist,
either in relational format or some other data model. Middle-tier server
applications can make these data available to customers through a Web
client. For example, UPS was able to make its parcel tracking system
available via the Web, tablet, or smartphone because the database
already existed. A middle-tier was written to connect customers using a
range of devices to the database.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❓ <em>Skill builder</em></p>
<p>A European city plans to establish a fleet of
two-person hybrid cars that can be rented for short periods (e.g.,
less than a day) for one-way trips. Potential renters first register
online and then receive via the postal system a smart card that is
used to gain entry to the car and pay automatically for its rental.
The city also plans to have an online reservation system that renters
can use to find the nearest car and reserve it. Reservations can be
held for up to 30 minutes, after which time the car is released for
use by other renters. Discuss the data processing architecture that
you would recommend to support this venture. What technology would you
need to install in each car? What technology would renters need? What
features would the smart card require? Are there alternatives to a
smart card?</p>

<div id="cloud-computing" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Cloud computing<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#cloud-computing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>With the development of client/server computing, many organizations
created data centers to contain the host of servers they needed to meet
their information processing requirements. These so-called server farms
can run to tens of thousands of servers. Because of security concerns,
many firms are unwilling to reveal the location and size of their server
farms. Google is reputed to have hundreds of thousands of servers. Many
corporations run much smaller, but still significantly costly, data
centers. Do they really need to run these centers?</p>
<p>The goal of the corporate IS unit should be to create and deploy systems
that meet the operational needs of the business or give it a competitive
advantage. It can gain little advantage from managing a data center. As
a result, some organizations have turned to cloud computing, which is
the use of shared hardware and software, to meet their processing needs.
Instead of storing data and running applications on the corporate data
center, applications and data are shifted to a third party data center,
the cloud, which is accessed via the Internet. Companies can select from
among several cloud providers. For example, it might run office
applications (word processing, spreadsheet, etc.) on the Google cloud,
and customer relationship management on Amazon’s cloud.</p>
<p>There are usually economies of scale from switching from an in-house
data center to the massive shared resources of a cloud provider, which
lowers the cost of information processing. As well, the IS unit can turn
its attention to the systems needs of the organization, without the
distraction of managing a data center.</p>
<p>Cloud computing vendors specialize in managing large-scale data centers.
As a result, they can lower costs in some areas that might be infeasible
for the typical corporation. For example, it is much cheaper to move
photons through fiber optics than electrons across the electricity
grid.<a href="data-administration.html#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> This means that some cloud server farms are
located where energy costs are low and minimal cooling is required.
Iceland and parts of Canada are good locations for server farms because
of inexpensive hydroelectric power and a cool climate. Information can
be moved to and fro on a fiber optic network to be processed at a cloud
site and then presented on the customer’s computer.</p>
<p>Cloud computing can be more than a way to save some data center
management costs. It has several features, or capabilities, that have
strategic implications.<a href="data-administration.html#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> We start by looking at the
levels or layers of clouds.</p>

<p>As the preceding table illustrates, there a several options for the
cloud customer. Someone looking to replace an office package installed
on each personal computer could select an offering in the Application
layer. A CIO looking to have complete control over a new application
being developed from scratch could look to the infrastructure cloud,
which also has the potential for high scalability.</p>

<h3>Cloud capabilities<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#cloud-capabilities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Understanding the strategic implications of cloud computing is of more
interest than the layers and types because a cloud’s seven capabilities
offer opportunities to address the five strategic challenges facing all
organizations.</p>
<div id="interface-control" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Interface control<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#interface-control" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Some cloud vendors provide their customers with an opportunity to shape
the form of interaction with the cloud. Under <em>open co-innovation</em>, a
cloud vendor has a very open and community-driven approach to services.
Customers and the vendor work together to determine the roadmap for
future services. Amazon follows this approach. The <em>qualified retail</em>
model requires developers to acquire permission and be certified before
releasing any new application on the vendor’s platform. This is the
model Apple uses with its app store. <em>Qualified
co-innovation</em> involves the community in the creation and maintenance of
application programming interfaces (APIs). Third parties using the APIs,
however, must be certified before they can be listed in the vendor’s
application store. This is the model salesforce.com uses. Finally, we
have the <em>open retail</em> model. Application developers have some influence
on APIs and new features, and they are completely free to write any
program on top of the system. This model is favored by Microsoft.</p>
</div>
<div id="location-independence" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Location independence<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#location-independence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>This capability means that data and applications can be accessed, with
appropriate permission, without needing to know the location of the
resources. This capability is particularly useful for serving customers
and employees across a wide variety of regions. There are some
challenges to location independence. Some countries restrict where data
about their citizens can be stored and who can access it.</p>
</div>
<div id="ubiquitous-access" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Ubiquitous access<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#ubiquitous-access" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Ubiquity means that customers and employees can access any information
service from any platform or device via a Web browser from anywhere.
Some clouds are not accessible in all parts of the globe at this stage
because of the lack of connectivity, sufficient bandwidth, or local
restrictions on cloud computing services.</p>
</div>
<div id="sourcing-independence" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Sourcing independence<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#sourcing-independence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>One of the attractions of cloud computing is that computing processing
power becomes a utility. As a result, a company could change cloud
vendors easily at low cost. It is a goal rather than a reality at this
stage of cloud development.</p>
</div>
<div id="virtual-business-environments" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Virtual business environments<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#virtual-business-environments" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Under cloud computing, some special needs systems can be built quickly
and later abandoned. For example, in 2009 the U.S. Government had a
<em>Cash for Clunkers</em> program that ran for a few months to encourage
people to trade-in their old car for a more fuel-efficient new car. This
short-lived system whose processing needs were hard to estimate was well
suited to a cloud environment. No resources need be acquired, and
processing power could be obtained as required.</p>

<h4>Addressability and traceability<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#addressability-and-traceability" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Traceability enables a company to track customers and employees who use
an information service. Depending on the device accessing an information
service, a company might be able to precisely identify the person and
the location of the request. This is particularly the case with
smartphones or tablets that have a GPS capability.</p>

<p>Organizations cannot always judge exactly their processing needs,

Clunkers</em> program. Ideally, an organization should be able to pull on a

<p>We now consider how the various capabilities of cloud computing are
related to these risks which are summarized in a table following the
discussion of each risk.</p>
<div id="demand-risk" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Demand risk<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#demand-risk" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Most companies are concerned about loss of demand, and make extensive
use of marketing techniques (e.g., advertising) to maintain and grow
demand. Cloud computing can boost demand by enabling customers to access
a service wherever they might be. For example, Amazon combines
ubiquitous access to its cloud and the Kindle, its book reader, to
permit customers to download and start reading a book wherever they have
access. Addressability and traceability enable a business to learn about
customers and their needs. By mining the data collected by cloud
applications, a firm can learn the connections between the when, where,
and what of customers’ wants. In the case of excessive demand, the
elasticity of cloud resources might help a company to serve higher than
expected demand.</p>
</div>
<div id="inefficiency-risk" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Inefficiency risk<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#inefficiency-risk" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>If a firm’s cost structure is higher than its competitors, its profit
margin will be less, and it will have less money to invest in new
products and services. Cloud computing offers several opportunities to
reduce cost. First, location independence means it can use a cloud to
provide many services to customers across a large geographic region
through a single electronic service facility. Second, sourcing
independence should result in a competitive market for processing power.
Cloud providers compete in a way that a corporate data center does not,
and competition typically drives down costs. Third, the ability to
quickly create and test new applications with minimal investment in
resources avoids many of the costs of procurement, installation, and the
danger of obsolete hardware and software. Finally, ubiquitous access
means employees can work from a wide variety of locations. For example,
ubiquity enables some to work conveniently and productively from home or
on the road, and thus the organization needs smaller and fewer
buildings.</p>
</div>
<div id="innovation-risk" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Innovation risk<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#innovation-risk" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>In most industries, enterprises need to continually introduce new
products and services. Even in quite stable industries with simple
products (e.g., coal mining), process innovation is often important for
lowering costs and delivering high quality products. The ability to
modify a cloud’s interface could be of relevance to innovation. Apple’s
App store restrictions might push some to Android’s more open model. As
mentioned in the previous section, the capability to put up and tear
down a virtual business environment quickly favors innovation because
the costs of experimenting are low. Ubiquitous access makes it easier to
engage customers and employees in product improvement. Customers use a
firm’s products every day, and some reinvent them or use them in ways
the firm never anticipated. A firm that learns of these unintended uses
might identify new markets and new features that will extend sales.
Addressability and traceability also enhance a firm’s ability to learn
about how, when, and where customers use electronic services and network
connected devices. Learning is the first step of innovation.</p>
</div>
<div id="scaling-risk" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Scaling risk<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#scaling-risk" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Sometimes a new product will takeoff, and a company will struggle to
meet unexpectedly high demand. If it can’t satisfy the market,
competitors will move in and capture the sales that the innovator was
unable to satisfy. In this case of digital products, a firm can use the
cloud’s elasticity to quickly acquire new storage and processing
resources. It might also take advantage of sourcing independence to use
multiple clouds, another form of elasticity, to meet burgeoning demand.</p>
</div>
<div id="control-risk" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Control risk<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#control-risk" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The 2008 recession clearly demonstrated the risk of inadequate controls.
In some cases, an organization acquired financial resources whose value
was uncertain. In others, companies lost track of what they owned
because of the complexity of financial instruments and the multiple
transactions involving them. A system’s interface is a point of data
capture, and a well-designed interface is a control mechanism. Although
it is usually not effective at identifying falsified data, it can
require that certain elements of data are entered. Addressability and
traceability also means that the system can record who entered the data,
from which device, and when.</p>

<div id="distributed-database" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Distributed database<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#distributed-database" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The client/server architecture is concerned with minimizing processing
costs by distributing processing between multiple clients and servers.
Another factor in the total processing cost equation is communication.
The cost of transmitting data usually increases with distance, and there
can be substantial savings by locating a database close to those most
likely to use it. The trade-off for a distributed database is lowered
communication costs versus increased complexity. While the Internet and
fiber optics have lowered the costs of communication, for a globally
distributed organization data transmission costs can still be an issue
because many countries still lack the bandwidth found in advanced
economies.</p>
<p>Distributed database architecture describes the situation where a
database is in more than one location but still accessible as if it were
centrally located. For example, a multinational organization might
locate its Indonesian data in Jakarta, its Japanese data in Tokyo, and
its Australian data in Sydney. If most queries deal with the local
situation, communication costs are substantially lower than if the
database were centrally located. Furthermore, since the database is
still treated as one logical entity, queries that require access to
different physical locations can be processed. For example, the query
“Find total sales of red hats in Australia” is likely to originate in
Australia and be processed using the Sydney part of the database. A
query of the form “Find total sales of red hats” is more likely to come
from a headquarters’ user and is resolved by accessing each of the local
databases, though the user need not be aware of where the data are
stored because the database appears as a single logical entity.</p>
<p>A distributed database management system (DDBMS) is a federation of
individual DBMSs. Each site has a local DBMS and DC manager. In many
respects, each site acts semi-independently. Each site also contains
additional software that enables it to be part of the federation and act
as a single database. It is this additional software that creates the
DDBMS and enables the multiple databases to appear as one.</p>
<p>A DDBMS introduces a need for a data store containing details of the
entire system. Information must be kept about the structure and location
of every database, table, row, and column and their possible replicas.
The system catalog is extended to include such information. The system
catalog must also be distributed; otherwise, every request for
information would have to be routed through some central point. For
instance, if the systems catalog were stored in Tokyo, a query on Sydney
data would first have to access the Tokyo-based catalog. This would
create a bottleneck.</p>
<div id="a-hybrid-distributed-architecture" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>A hybrid, distributed architecture<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#a-hybrid-distributed-architecture" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Any organization of a reasonable size is likely to have a mix of the
data processing architectures. Databases will exist on stand-alone
personal computers, multiple client/server networks, distributed
mainframes, clouds, and so on. Architectures continue to evolve because
information technology is dynamic. Today’s best solutions for data
processing can become obsolete very quickly. Yet, organizations have
invested large sums in existing systems that meet their current needs
and do not warrant replacement. As a result, organizations evolve a
hybrid architecture—a mix of the various forms. The concern of the IS
unit is how to patch this hybrid together so that clients see it as a
seamless system that readily provides needed information. In creating
this ideal system, there are some underlying key concepts that should be
observed. These fundamental principles were initially stated in terms of
a distributed database. However, they can be considered to apply broadly
to the evolving, hybrid architecture that organizations must continually
fashion.</p>

</div>
<div id="transparency" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Transparency<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#transparency" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The user should not have to know where data are stored nor how they are
processed. The location of data, its storage format, and access method
should be invisible to the client. The system should accept queries and
resolve them expeditiously. Of course, the system should check that the
person is authorized to access the requested data. Transparency is also
known as <strong>location independence</strong>—the system can be used
independently of the location of data.</p>
</div>
<div id="no-reliance-on-a-central-site" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>No reliance on a central site<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#no-reliance-on-a-central-site" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Reliance on a central site for management of a hybrid architecture
creates two major problems. <em>First</em>, because all requests are routed
through the central site, bottlenecks develop during peak periods.
<em>Second</em>, if the central site fails, the entire system fails. A
controlling central site is too vulnerable, and control should be
distributed throughout the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="local-autonomy" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Local autonomy<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#local-autonomy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A high degree of local autonomy avoids dependence on a central site.
Data are locally owned and managed. The local site is responsible for
the security, integrity, and storage of local data. There cannot be
absolute local autonomy because the various sites must cooperate in
order for transparency to be feasible. Cooperation always requires
relinquishing some autonomy.</p>
</div>
<div id="continuous-operation" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Continuous operation<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#continuous-operation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The system must be accessible when required. Since business is
increasingly global and clients are geographically dispersed, the system
must be continuously available. Many data centers now describe their
operations as “24/7” (24 hours a day and 7 days a week). Clouds must
operate continuously.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributed-query-processing" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Distributed query processing<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#distributed-query-processing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The time taken to execute a query should be generally independent of the
location from which it is submitted. Deciding the most efficient way to
process the query is the system’s responsibility, not the client’s. For
example, a Sydney analyst could submit the query, “Find sales of winter
coats in Japan.” The system is responsible for deciding which messages
and data to send between the various sites where tables are located.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributed-transaction-processing" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Distributed transaction processing<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#distributed-transaction-processing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In a hybrid system, a single transaction can require updating of
multiple files at multiple sites. The system must ensure that a
transaction is successfully executed for all sites. Partial updating of
files will cause inconsistencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="fragmentation-independence" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Fragmentation independence<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#fragmentation-independence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Fragmentation independence means that any table can be broken into
fragments and then stored in separate physical locations. For example,
the sales table could be fragmented so that Indonesian data are stored
in Jakarta, Japanese data in Tokyo, and so on. A fragment is any piece
of a table that can be created by applying restriction and projection
operations. Using join and union, fragments can be assembled to create
the full table. Fragmentation is the key to a distributed database.
Without fragmentation independence, data cannot be distributed.</p>
</div>
<div id="replication-independence" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Replication independence<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#replication-independence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Fragmentation is good when local data are mainly processed locally, but
there are some applications that also frequently process remote data.
For example, the New York office of an international airline may need
both American (local) and European (remote) data, and its London office
may need American (remote) and European (local) data. In this case,
fragmentation into American and European data may not substantially
reduce communication costs.</p>
<p>Replication means that a fragment of data can be copied and physically
stored at multiple sites; thus the European fragment could be replicated
and stored in New York, and the American fragment replicated and stored
in London. As a result, applications in both New York and London will
reduce their communication costs. Of course, the trade-off is that when
a replicated fragment is updated, all copies also must be updated.
Reduced communication costs are exchanged for increased update
complexity.</p>
<p>Replication independence implies that replication happens behind the
scenes. The client is oblivious to replication and requires no knowledge
of this activity.</p>
<p>There are two major approaches to replication: synchronous or
asynchronous updates. <strong>Synchronous replication</strong> means all databases
are updated at the same time. Although this is ideal, it is not a simple
task and is resource intensive. <strong>Asynchronous replication</strong> occurs when
changes made to one database are relayed to other databases within a
certain period established by the database administrator. It does not
provide real-time updating, but it takes fewer IS resources.
Asynchronous replication is a compromise strategy for distributed DBMS
replication. When real-time updating is not absolutely necessary,
asynchronous replication can save IS resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="hardware-independence" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Hardware independence<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#hardware-independence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A hybrid architecture should support hardware from multiple suppliers
without affecting the users’ capacity to query files. Hardware
independence is a long-term goal of many IS managers. With
virtualization, under which a computer can run another operating system,
hardware independence has become less of an issue. For example, a
Macintosh can run OS X (the native system), a variety of Windows
operating systems, and many variations of Linux.</p>
</div>
<div id="operating-system-independence" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Operating system independence<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#operating-system-independence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Operating system independence is another goal much sought after by IS
executives. Ideally, the various DBMSs and applications of the hybrid
system should work on a range of operating systems on a variety of
hardware. Browser-based systems are a way of providing operating system
independence.</p>
</div>
<div id="network-independence" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Network independence<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#network-independence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Clearly, network independence is desired by organizations that wish to
avoid the electronic shackles of being committed to any single hardware
or software supplier.</p>
</div>
<div id="dbms-independence" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>DBMS independence<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#dbms-independence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The drive for independence is contagious and has been caught by the DBMS
as well. Since SQL is a standard for relational databases, organizations
may well be able to achieve DBMS independence. By settling on the
relational model as the organizational standard, ensuring that all DBMSs
installed conform to this model, and using only standard SQL, an
organization may approach DBMS independence. Nevertheless, do not forget
all those old systems from the pre-relational days—a legacy that must
be supported in a hybrid architecture.</p>
<p>Organizations can gain considerable DBMS independence by using Open
Database Connectivity (ODBC) technology, which was covered earlier in
the chapter on SQL. An application that uses the ODBC interface can
access any ODBC-compliant DBMS. In a distributed environment, such as an
n-tier client/server, ODBC enables application servers to access a
variety of vendors’ databases on different data servers.</p>

<h3>Conclusion—paradise postponed<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#conclusionparadise-postponed" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>For data managers, the 12 principles just outlined are ideal goals. In
the hurly-burly of everyday business, incomplete information, and an
uncertain future, data managers struggle valiantly to meet clients’
needs with a hybrid architecture that is an imperfect interpretation of
IS paradise. It is unlikely that these principles will ever be totally
achieved. They are guidelines and something to reflect on when making
the inevitable trade-offs that occur in data management.</p>
<p>Now that you understand the general goals of a distributed database
architecture, we will consider the major aspects of the enabling
technology. First, we will look at distributed data access methods and
then distributed database design. In keeping with our focus on the
relational model, illustrative SQL examples are used.</p>

<div id="distributed-data-access" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Distributed data access<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#distributed-data-access" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>When data are distributed across multiple locations, the data management
logic must be adapted to recognize multiple locations. The various types
of distributed data access methods are considered, and an example is
used to illustrate the differences between the methods.</p>
<div id="remote-request" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Remote request<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#remote-request" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A remote request occurs when an application issues a single data request
to a single remote site. Consider the case of a branch bank requesting
data for a specific customer from the bank’s central server located in
Atlanta. The SQL command specifies the name of the server (<code>atlserver</code>),
the database (<code>bankdb</code>), and the name of the table (<code>customer</code>).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb428"><pre class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb428-1"><a href="data-processing-architectures.html#cb428-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">SELECT</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="kw">FROM</span> atlserver.bankdb.customer</span>

<p>A remote request can extract a table from the database for processing on
the local database. For example, the Athens branch may download balance
details of customers at the beginning of each day and handle queries
locally rather than issuing a remote request. The SQL is</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb429"><pre class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb429-1"><a href="data-processing-architectures.html#cb429-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">SELECT</span> custcode, custbalance <span class="kw">FROM</span> atlserver.bankdb.customer</span>

</div>
<div id="remote-transaction" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Remote transaction<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#remote-transaction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Multiple data requests are often necessary to execute a complete
business transaction. For example, to add a new customer account might
require inserting a row in two tables: one row for the account and
another row in the table relating a customer to the new account. A
remote transaction contains multiple data requests for a single remote
location. The following example illustrates how a branch bank creates a
new customer account on the central server:</p>

<p>The commands BEGIN WORK and COMMIT WORK surround the SQL commands

</div>
<div id="distributed-transaction" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Distributed transaction<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#distributed-transaction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A distributed transaction supports multiple data requests for data at
multiple locations. Each request is for data on a single server. Support
for distributed transactions permits a client to access tables on
different servers.</p>
<p>Consider the case of a bank that operates in the United States and
Norway and keeps details of employees on a server in the country in
which they reside. The following example illustrates a revision of the
database to record details of an employee who moves from the United
States to Norway. The transaction copies the data for the employee from
the Atlanta server to the Oslo server and then deletes the entry for
that employee on the Atlanta server.</p>

<p>A distributed request is the most complicated form of distributed data
access. It supports processing of multiple requests at multiple sites,
and each request can access data on multiple sites. This means that a
distributed request can handle data replicated or fragmented across
multiple servers.</p>

<p>The transaction first creates a view containing all employees by a union
on the employee tables for both locations. This view is then used to
calculate the bonus. Two SQL update commands then update the respective
retirement fund records of the U.S. and Norwegian employees. Notice that
retirement funds are recorded in U.S. dollars or Norwegian kroner.</p>
<p>Ideally, a distributed request should not require the application to
know where data are physically located. A DDBMS should not require the
application to specify the name of the server. So, for example, it
should be possible to write the following SQL:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb433"><pre class="sourceCode sql"><code class="sourceCode sql"><span id="cb433-1"><a href="data-processing-architectures.html#cb433-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">SELECT</span> empcode, empfname, emplname, empsalary<span class="op">*</span>.<span class="dv">15</span> <span class="kw">AS</span> bonus</span>

<p>It is the responsibility of the DDBMS to determine where data are
stored. In other words, the DDBMS is responsible for ensuring data
location and fragmentation transparency.</p>

<h2>Distributed database design<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#distributed-database-design" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Designing a distributed database is a two-stage process. <em>First<strong>,</strong></em>
develop a data model using the principles discussed in Section 2.
<em>Second</em>, decide how data and processing will be distributed by applying
the concepts of partitioning and replication. <strong>Partitioning</strong> is the
fragmentation of tables across servers. Tables can be fragmented
horizontally, vertically, or by some combination of both.
<strong>Replication</strong> is the duplication of tables across servers.</p>

<div id="vertical-fragmentation" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Vertical fragmentation<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#vertical-fragmentation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>When vertically fragmented, a table is split into columns. For example,
a firm may fragment its employee table vertically to spread the
processing load across servers. There could be one server to handle
address lookups and another to process payroll. In this case, the
columns containing address information would be stored on one server and
payroll columns on the other server. Notice that the primary key column
(c1) must be stored on both servers; otherwise, the entity integrity
rule is violated.</p>

<div id="hybrid-fragmentation" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Hybrid fragmentation<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#hybrid-fragmentation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Hybrid fragmentation is a mixture of horizontal and vertical. For
example, the employee table could be first horizontally fragmented to
distribute the data to where employees are located. Then, some of the
horizontal fragments could be vertically fragmented to split processing
across servers. Thus, if Tokyo is the corporate headquarters with many
employees, the Tokyo horizontal fragment of the employee database could
be vertically fragmented so that separate servers could handle address
and payroll processing.</p>
<p>Horizontal fragmentation distributes data and thus can be used to reduce
communication costs by storing data where they are most likely to be
needed. Vertical fragmentation is used to distribute data across servers
so that the processing load can be distributed. Hybrid fragmentation can
be used to distribute both data and applications across servers.</p>

<div id="replication" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Replication<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#replication" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Under replication, tables can be fully or partly replicated. <strong>Full
replication</strong> means that tables are duplicated at each of the sites. The
advantages of full replication are greater data integrity (because
replication is essentially mirroring) and faster processing (because it
can be done locally). However, replication is expensive because of the
need to synchronize inserts, updates, and deletes across the replicated
tables. When one table is altered, all the replicas must also be
modified. A compromise is to use <strong>partial replication</strong> by duplicating
the indexes only. This will increase the speed of query processing. The
index can be processed locally, and then the required rows retrieved
from the remote database.</p>

<h3>Conclusion<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#conclusion-7" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The two fundamental skills of data management, data modeling and data
querying, are not changed by the development of a distributed data
architecture such as client/server and the adoption of cloud computing.
Data modeling remains unchanged. A high-fidelity data model is required
regardless of where data are stored and whichever architecture is
selected. SQL can be used to query local, remote, and distributed
databases. Indeed, the adoption of client/server technology has seen a
widespread increase in the demand for SQL skills.</p>

<div id="summary-21" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Summary<a href="data-processing-architectures.html#summary-21" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Data can be stored and processed locally or remotely. Combinations of
these two options provide the basic architecture options: remote job
entry, personal database, and client/server. Many organizations are
looking to cloud computing to reduce the processing costs and to allow
them to focus on building systems. Cloud computing can also provide
organizations with a competitive advantage if they exploit its seven
capabilities to reduce one or more of the strategic risks.</p>
<p>Under distributed database architecture, a database is in more than one
location but still accessible as if it were centrally located. The
trade-off is lowered communication costs versus increased complexity. A
hybrid architecture is a mix of data processing architectures. The
concern of the IS department is to patch this hybrid together so that
clients see a seamless system that readily provides needed information.
The fundamental principles that a hybrid architecture should satisfy are
transparency, no reliance on a central site, local autonomy, continuous
operation, distributed query processing, distributed transaction
processing, fragmentation independence, replication independence,
hardware independence, operating system independence, network
independence, and DBMS independence.</p>
<p>There are four types of distributed data access. In order of complexity,
these are remote request, remote transaction, distributed transaction,
and distributed request.</p>
<p>Distributed database design is based on the principles of fragmentation
and replication. Horizontal fragmentation splits a table by rows and
reduces communication costs by placing data where they are likely to be
required. Vertical fragmentation splits a table by columns and spreads
the processing load across servers. Hybrid fragmentation is a
combination of horizontal and vertical fragmentation. Replication is the
duplication of identical tables at different sites. Partial replication
involves the replication of indexes. Replication speeds up local
processing at the cost of maintaining the replicas.</p>

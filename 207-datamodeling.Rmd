### Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

Students completing this chapter will be able to create a well-formed,
high-fidelity data model.

## Modeling {.unnumbered}

Modeling is widely used within business to learn about organizational
problems and design solutions. To understand where data modeling fits
within the broader context, it is useful to review the full range of
modeling activities. The types of modeling methods follow the 5W-H model
of journalism.[^datamodeling-1]

[^datamodeling-1]:  Roberto Franzosi, "On Quantitative Narrative
    Analysis," in Varieties of Narrative Analysis, ed. James A. Holstein
    and Jaber F. Gubrium (SAGE Publications, Inc., 2012), 75--96.

*A broad perspective on modeling*

|                |       | **Scope**      | **Model**            | **Technology**       |
|----------------|-------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Motivation** | Why   | Goals          | Business plan canvas | Groupware            |
| **People**     | Who   | Business units | Organization chart   | System interface     |
| **Time**       | When  | Key events     | PERT chart           | Scheduling           |
| **Data**       | What  | Key entities   | Data model           | Relational database  |
| **Network**    | Where | Locations      | Logistics network    | System architecture  |
| **Function**   | How   | Key processes  | Process model        | Application software |

Modeling occurs at multiple levels. At the highest level, an
organization needs to determine the scope of its business by identifying
the major elements of its environment, such as its goals, business
units, where it operates, and critical events, entities, and processes.
At the top level, textual models are frequently used. For example, an
organization might list its major goals and business processes. A map
will be typically used to display where the business operates.

Once senior managers have clarified the scope of a business, models can
be constructed for each of the major elements. Goals will be converted
into a business plan, business units will be shown on an organizational
chart, and so on. The key elements, from an IS perspective, are data and
process modeling, which are typically covered in the core courses of an
IS program.

Technology, the final stage, converts models into operational systems to
support the organization. Many organizations rely extensively on e-mail
and Web technology for communicating business decisions. People connect
to systems through an interface, such as a Web browser. Ensuring that
events occur at the right time is managed by scheduling software. This
could be implemented with operating system procedures that schedule the
execution of applications. In some database management systems (DBMSs),
triggers can be established. A **trigger** is a database procedure that
is automatically executed when some event is recognized. For example,
U.S. banks are required to report all deposits exceeding USD 10,000, and
a trigger could be coded for this event.

Data models are typically converted into relational databases, and
process models become computer programs. Thus, you can see that data
modeling is one element of a comprehensive modeling activity that is
often required to design business systems. When a business undergoes a
major change, such as a reengineering project, many dimensions can be
altered, and it may be appropriate to rethink many elements of the
business, starting with its goals. Because such major change is very
disruptive and costly, it occurs less frequently. It is more likely that
data modeling is conducted as a stand-alone activity or part of process
modeling to create a new business application.

## Data modeling {.unnumbered}

You were introduced to the basic building blocks of data modeling in the
earlier chapters of this section. Now it is time to learn how to
assemble blocks to build a data model. Data modeling is a method for
determining what data and relationships should be stored in the
database. It is also a way of communicating a database design.

The goal of data modeling is to identify the facts that must be stored
in a database. A data model is not concerned with how the data will be
stored. This is the concern of those who implement the database. A data
model is not concerned with how the data will be processed. This is the
province of process modeling. The goal is to create a data model that is
an accurate representation of data needs and real-world data
relationships.

Building a data model is a partnership between a client, a
representative of the eventual owners of the database, and a designer.
Of course, there can be a team of clients and designers. For simplicity,
we assume there is one client and one designer.

Drawing a data model is an iterative process of trial and revision. A
data model is a working document that will change as you learn more
about the client's needs and world. Your early versions are likely to be
quite different from the final product. Use a product such as MySQL
Workbench for drawing and revising a data model.

## The building blocks {.unnumbered}

The purpose of a database is to store data about things, which can
include facts (e.g., an exchange rate), plans (e.g., scheduled
production of two-person tents for June), estimates (e.g., forecast of
demand for smart phones), and a variety of other data. A data model
describes these things and their relationships with other things using
four components: entity, attribute, relationship, and identifier.

### Entity {.unnumbered}

The entity is the basic building block of a data model. an entity is a
thing about which data should be stored, something we need to describe.
Each entity in a data model has a unique name that we write in singular
form. Why singular? Because we want to emphasize that an entity
describes an instance of a thing. Thus, we previously used the word
SHARE to define an entity because it describes each instance of a share
rather than shares in general.

We have already introduced the convention that an entity is represented
by a rectangle, and the name of the entity is shown in uppercase
letters, as follows.

*The entity SHARE*

![](Figures/Chapter%203/share.png){width="152"}

A large data model might contain over a 1,000 entities. A database can
easily contain hundreds of millions of instances (rows) for any one
entity (table). Imagine the number of instances in a national tax
department's database.

How do you begin to identify entities? One approach is to underline any
*nouns* in the system proposal or provided documentation. Most nouns are
possible entities, and underlining ensures that you do not overlook any
potential entities. Start by selecting an entity that seems central to
the problem. If you were designing a student database, you might start
with the student. Once you have picked a central entity, describe it.
Then move to the others.

### Attribute {.unnumbered}

An attribute describes an entity. When an entity has been identified,
the next step is to determine its attributes, that is, the data that
should be kept to describe fully the entity. An attribute name is
singular and unique within the data model. You may need to use a
modifier to make an attribute name unique (e.g., "hire date" and "sale
date" rather than just "date").

Our convention is that the name of an attribute is recorded in lowercase
letters within the entity rectangle. The following figure illustrates
that SHARE has attributes *share code, share name, share price, share
quantity, share dividend,* and *share PE*. Notice the frequent use of
the modifier "share". It is possible that other entities in the database
might also have a price and quantity, so we use a modifier to create
unique attribute names. Note also that *share cod*e is the identifier.

*The entity SHARE with its attributes*

![](Figures/Chapter%203/share%20with%20attributes.png){width="152"}

Defining attributes generally takes considerable discussion with the
client. You should include any attribute that is likely to be required
for present or future decision making, but don't get carried away. Avoid
storing unnecessary data. For example, to describe the entity STUDENT
you usually record date of birth, but it is unlikely that you would
store height. If you were describing an entity PATIENT, on the other
hand, it might be necessary to record height, because that is sometimes
relevant to medical decision making.

An attribute has a single value, which may be null. Multiple values are
not allowed. If you need to store multiple values, it is a signal that
you have a one-to-many (1:m) relationship and need to define another
entity.

### Relationship {.unnumbered}

Entities are related to other entities. If there were no relationships
between entities, there would be no need for a data model and no need
for a relational database. A simple, flat file (a single-entity
database) would be sufficient. A relationship is binary. It describes a
linkage between two entities and is represented by a line between them.

Because a relationship is binary, strictly speaking it has two
relationship descriptors, one for each entity. Each relationship
descriptor has a degree stating how many instances of the other entity
may be related to each instance of the described entity. Consider the
entities STOCK and NATION and their 1:m relationship (see the following
figure). We have two relationship descriptors: *stocks of nation* for
NATION and *nation of stock* for STOCK. The relationship descriptor
*stocks of nation* has a degree of m because a nation may have zero or
more listed stocks. The relationship descriptor *nation of stock* has a
degree of 1 because a stock is listed in at most one nation. To reduce
data model clutter, where necessary for clarification, we will use a
single label for the pair of relationship descriptors. Experience shows
this approach captures the meaning of the relationship and improves
readability.

*A 1:m relationship between STOCK and NATION*

![](Figures/Chapter%204/nation-stock.png){width="374"}

Because the meaning of relationships frequently can be inferred, there
is no need to label every one; however, each additional relationship
between two entities should be labeled to clarify meaning. Also, it is a
good idea to label one-to-one (1:1) relationships, because the meaning
of the relationship is not always obvious.

Consider the fragment in the following figure. The descriptors of the
1:m relationship can be inferred as a firm has employees and an employee
belongs to a firm. the 1:1 relationship is clarified by labeling the 1:1
relationship as firm's boss.

*Relationship labeling*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/relationship%20labeling.png)

### Identifier {.unnumbered}

An identifier uniquely distinguishes an instance of an entity. An
identifier can be one or more attributes and may include the identifier
of a related entity. When a related entity's identifier is part of an
identifier, a plus sign is placed on the line closest to the entity
being identified. In the following figure, an instance of the entity
LINEITEM is identified by the composite of *lineno* and *saleno*, the
identifier of SALE. The value *lineno* does not uniquely identify an
instance of LINEITEM, because it is simply a number that appears on the
sales form. Thus, the identifier must include *saleno* (the identifier
of SALE). So, any instance of LINEITEM is uniquely identified by the
composite *saleno* and *lineno*.

*A related entity's identifier as part of the identifier*

![](Figures/Chapter%205/sale-item.png){width="561"}

Occasionally, there will be several possible identifiers, and these are
each given a different symbol. Our convention is to prefix an identifier
with an asterisk (\*). If there are multiple identifiers, use other
symbols such as #, !, or &. Be careful: If you have too many possible
identifiers, your model will look like comic book swearing. In most
cases, you will have only one identifier.

No part of an identifier can be null. If this were permitted, there
would be no guarantee that the other parts of the identifier were
sufficiently unique to distinguish all instances in the database.

## Data model quality {.unnumbered}

There are two criteria for judging the quality of a data model. It must
be well-formed and have high fidelity.

### A well-formed data model {.unnumbered}

A well-formed data model clearly communicates information to the client.
Being well-formed means the construction rules have been obeyed. There
is no ambiguity; all entities are named, and all entities have
identifiers. If identifiers are missing, the client may make incorrect
inferences about the data model. All relationships are recorded using
the proper notation and labeled whenever there is a possibility of
confusion.

*Characteristics of a well-formed data model*

| All construction rules are obeyed.                             |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| There is no ambiguity.                                         |
| All entities are named.                                        |
| Every entity has an identifier.                                |
| All relationships are represented, using the correct notation. |
| Relationships are labeled to avoid misunderstanding.           |
| All attributes of each entity are listed.                      |
| All attribute names are meaningful and unique.                 |

All the attributes of an entity are listed because missing attributes
create two types of problems. *First**,*** it is unclear what data will
be stored about each instance. *Second*, the data model may be missing
some relationships. Attributes that can have multiple values become
entities. It is only by listing all of an entity's attributes during
data modeling that these additional entities are recognized.

In a well-formed data model, all attribute names are meaningful and
unique. The names of entities, identifiers, attributes, and
relationships must be meaningful to the client because they are describe
the client's world. Indeed, in nearly all cases they are the client's
everyday names. Take care in selecting words because they are critical
to communicating meaning. The acid test for comprehension is to get the
client to read the data model to other potential users. Names need to be
unique to avoid confusion.

### A high-fidelity image {.unnumbered}

Music lovers aspire to own a high-fidelity stereo system---one that
faithfully reproduces the original performance with minimal or no
distortion. A data model is a high-fidelity image when it faithfully
describes the world it is supposed to represent. All relationships are
recorded and are of the correct degree. There are no compromises or
distortions. If the real-world relationship is many-to-many (m:m), then
so is the relationship shown in the data model. a well-formed,
high-fidelity data model is complete, understandable, accurate, and
syntactically correct.

## Quality improvement {.unnumbered}

A data model is an evolving representation. Each change should be an
incremental improvement in quality. Occasionally, you will find a major
quality problem at the data model's core and have to change the model
considerably.

### Detail and context {.unnumbered}

The quality of a data model can be determined only by understanding the
context in which it will be used. Consider the data model (see the
following figure) used in Chapter 4 to discuss the 1:m relationship.
This fragment says a nation has many stocks. Is that really what we want
to represent? Stocks are listed on a stock exchange, and a nation may
have several stock exchanges. For example, the U.S. has the New York
Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Furthermore, some foreign stocks are listed
on the New York Stock Exchange. If this is the world we have to
describe, the data model is likely to differ from that shown in the
figure. Try drawing the revised data model.

*A 1:m relationship between STOCK and NATION*

![](Figures/Chapter%204/nation-stock.png){width="374"}

As you can see, the data model in the following figure is quite
different from the initial data model of preceding figure. Which one is
better? They both can be valid models; it just depends on the world you
are trying to represent and possible future queries. In the first case,
the purpose was to determine the value of a portfolio. There was no
interest in on which exchange stocks were listed or their home exchange.
So the first model has high fidelity for the described situation.

The second data model would be appropriate if the client needed to know
the home exchange of stocks and their price on the various exchanges
where they were listed. The second data model is an improvement on the
first if it incorporates the additional facts and relationships
required. If it does not, then the additional detail is not worth the
extra cost.

*Revised NATION-STOCK data*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/revised%20NATION-STOCK.png)

### A lesson in pure geography {.unnumbered}

A data model must be an accurate representation of the world you want to
model. The data model must account for all the exceptions---there should
be no impurities. Let's say you want to establish a database to store
details of the world's cities. You might start with the data model
depicted in the following figure.

*A world's cities data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/geography.png){width="540"}

Before looking more closely at the data model, let's clarify the meaning
of *unittype*. Because most countries are divided into administrative
units that are variously called states, provinces, territories, and so
forth, *unittype* indicates the type of administrative unit (e.g.,
state). How many errors can you find in the initial data model?

This geography lesson demonstrates how you often start with a simple
model of low fidelity. By additional thinking about relationships and
consideration of exceptions, you gradually create a high-fidelity data
model.

### Family matters {.unnumbered}

Families can be very complicated. It can be tricky to keep track of all
those relations---maybe you need a relational database (this is the
worst joke in the book; they improve after this). We start with a very
limited view of marriage and gradually ease the restrictions to
demonstrate how any and all aspects of a relationship can be modeled. An
initial fragment of the data model is shown in the following figure.
There are several things to notice about it.

*A man-woman data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/marriage-1.png){width="527"}

1.  There is a 1:1 relationship between man and woman. The labels
    indicate that this relationship is marriage, but there is no
    indication of the marriage date. We are left to infer that the data
    model records the current marriage.

2.  MAN and WOMAN have the same attributes. A prefix is used to make
    them unique. Both have an identifier (*id*, in the United States
    this would probably be a Social Security number), date of birth
    (*dob*), first name (*fname*), other names (*oname*), and last name
    (*name*).

3.  Other names (*oname*) looks like a multivalued attribute, which is
    not allowed. Should *oname* be single or multivalue? This is a
    tricky decision. It depends on how these data will be used. If
    queries such as "find all men whose other names include Herbert" are
    likely, then a person's other names---kept as a separate entity that
    has a 1:m relationship for MAN and WOMAN---must be established. That
    is, a man or woman can have one or more other names. However, if you
    just want to store the data for completeness and retrieve it in its
    entirety, then *oname* is fine. It is just a text string. The key
    question to ask is, "What is the lowest level of detail possibly
    required for future queries?" Also, remember that SQL's REGEXP
    clause can be used to search for values within a text string.

The use of a prefix to distinguish attribute names in different entities
suggests you should consider combining the entities. In this case, we
could combine the entities MAN and WOMAN to create an entity called
PERSON. Usually when entities are combined, you have to create a new
attribute to distinguish between the different types. In this example,
the attribute *gender* is added. We can also generalize the relationship
label to *spouse*. The revised data model appears in the following
figure.

*A PERSON data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/marriage-2.png){width="257"}

Now for a bit of marriage counseling. Marriage normally is a
relationship between two people. Is that so? Well, some societies permit
polygyny (one man can have many wives), others allow polyandry (one
woman can have many husbands), and some permit same-sex marriages. So
marriage, if we consider all the possibilities, is an m:m relationship
between people, and partner might be a better choice than spouse for
labeling the relationship Also, a person can be married more than once.
To distinguish between different marriages, we really need to record the
start and end date of each relationship and who was involved.

*A marriage data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/marriage-3.png){width="360"}

Marriage is an m:m relationship between two persons. It has attributes
*begindate* and *enddate*. An instance of marriage is uniquely
identified by a composite identifier: the two spouse identifiers and
*begindate*. This means any marriage is uniquely identified by the
composite of two person identifiers and the beginning date of the
marriage. We need *begindate* as part of the identifier because the same
couple might have more than one marriage (e.g., get divorced and remarry
each other later). Furthermore, we can safely assume that it is
impossible for a couple to get married, divorced, and remarried all on
the one day. *Begindate* and *enddate* can be used to determine the
current state of a marriage. If *enddate* is null, the marriage is
current; otherwise, the couple has divorced.

This data model assumes a couple goes through some formal process to get
married or divorced, and there is an official date for both of these
events. What happens if they just gradually drift into cohabitation, and
there is no official beginning date? Think about it. (The data model
problem, that is---not cohabitation!) Many countries recognize this
situation as a common-law marriage, so the data model needs to recognize
it. The present data model cannot handle this situation because
*begindate* cannot be null---it is an identifier. Instead, a new
identifier is needed, and *begindate* should become an attribute.

Two new attributes can handle a common-law marriage. *Marriageno* can
count the number of times a couple has been married to each other. In
the majority of cases, *marriageno* will be 1. *Marriagestatus* can
record whether a marriage is current or ended. Now we have a data model
that can also handle common-law marriages. This is also a high-quality
data model in that the client does not have to remember to examine
*enddate* to determine a marriage's current status. It is easier to
remember to examine *marriagestatus* to check status. Also, we can allow
a couple to be married, divorced, and remarried as many times as they
like on the one day---which means we can now use the database in Las
Vegas.

*A revised marriage data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/marriage-4.png){width="360"}

All right, now that we have the couple successfully married, we need to
start thinking about children. A marriage has zero or more children, and
let's start with the assumption a child belongs to only one marriage.
Therefore, we have a 1:m relationship between marriage and person to
represent the children of a marriage.

*A marriage with children data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/marriage-5.png){width="435"}

You might want to consider how the model would change to handle
single-parent families, adopted children, and other aspects of human
relationships.

### When's a book not a book? {.unnumbered}

Sometimes we have to rethink our ideas of physical objects. Consider a
data model for a library.

*A library data model fragment*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/library-1.png)

The preceding fragment assumes that a person borrows a book. What
happens if the library has two copies of the book? Do we add an
attribute to BOOK called *copy number*? No, because we would introduce
redundancy by repeating the same information for each book. What you
need to recognize is that in the realm of data modeling, a book is not
really a physical thing, but the copy is, because it is what you borrow.

*A revised library data model fragment*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/library-2.png)

As you can see, a book has many copies, and a copy is of one book. A
book can be identified by *callno*, which is usually a Library of
Congress number or Dewey number. A copy is identified by a *bookno*.
This is a unique number allocated by the library to the copy of the
book. If you look in a library book, you will generally find it pasted
on the inside back cover and shown in numeric and bar code format.
Notice that it is called *book number* despite the fact that it really
identifies a copy of a book. This is because most people, including
librarians, think of the copy as a book.

The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) uniquely identifies any
instance of a book (not copy). Although it sounds like a potential
identifier for BOOK, it is not. ISBNs were introduced in the second half
of the twentieth century, and books published before then do not have an
ISBN.

### A history lesson {.unnumbered}

Many organizations maintain historical data (e.g., a person's job
history or a student's enrollment record). A data model can depict
historical data relationships just as readily as current data
relationships.

Consider the case of an employee who works for a firm that consists of
divisions (e.g., production) and departments (e.g., quality control).
The firm contains many departments, but a department belongs to only one
division. At any one time, an employee belongs to only one department.

*Employment history---take 1*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/history-1.png)

The fragment in the figure can be amended to keep track of the divisions
and departments in which a person works. While employed with a firm, a
person can work in more than one department. Since a department can have
many employees, we have an m:m relationship between DEPARTMENT and
EMPLOYEE. We might call the resulting associative entity POSITION.

*Employment history---take 2*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/history-2.png)

The revised fragment records employee work history. Note that any
instance of POSITION is identified by *begdate* and the identifiers for
EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT. The fragment is typical of what happens when
you move from just keeping current data to recording history. A 1:m
becomes an m:m relationship to record history.

People who work get paid. How do we keep track of an employee's pay
data? An employee has many pay slips, but a pay slip belongs to one
employee. When you look at a pay slip, you will find it contains many
items: gross pay and a series of deductions for tax, medical insurance,
and so on. Think of a pay slip as containing many lines, analogous to a
sales form. Now look at the revised data model.

*Employment history---take 3*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/history-3.png)

Typically, an amount shown on a pay slip is identified by a short text
field (e.g., gross pay). PAYSLIPLINE contains an attribute *psltype* to
identify the text that should accompany an amount, but where is the
text? When dealing with codes like *psltype* and their associated text,
the fidelity of a data model is improved by creating a separate entity,
PSLTEXT, for the code and its text.

*Employment history---take 4*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/history-4.png)

### A ménage à trois for entities {.unnumbered}

Consider aircraft leasing. A plane is leased to an airline for a
specific period. When a lease expires, the plane can be leased to
another airline. So, an aircraft can be leased many times, and an
airline can lease many aircraft. Furthermore, there is an agent
responsible for handling each deal. An agent can lease many aircraft and
deal with many airlines. Over time, an airline will deal with many
agents. When an agent reaches a deal with an airline to lease a
particular aircraft, you have a transaction. If you analyze the aircraft
leasing business, you discover there are three m:m relationships. You
might think of these as three separate relationships.

*An aircraft-airline-agent data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/airline.png)

The problem with three separate m:m relationships is that it is unclear
where to store data about the lease. Is it stored in AIRLINE-AIRCRAFT?
If you store the information there, what do you do about recording the
agent who closed the deal? After you read the fine print and do some
more thinking, you discover that a lease is the association of these
three entities in an m:m relationship.

### Project management---planning and doing {.unnumbered}

Project management involves both planned and actual data. A project is
divided into a number of activities that use resources. Planning
includes estimation of the resources to be consumed. When a project is
being executed, managers keep track of the resources used to monitor
progress and keep the project on budget. Planning data may not be as
detailed as actual data and is typically fairly broad, such as an
estimate of the number of hours that an activity will take. Actual data
will be more detailed because they are usually collected by getting
those assigned to the project to log a daily account of how they spent
their time. Also, resources used on a project are allocated to a
particular activity. For the purposes of this data model, we will focus
only on recording time and nothing else.

*A project management data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/planning.png)

Notice that *planned hours* is an attribute of ACTIVITY, and *actual
hours* is an attribute of DAILY WORK. The hours spent on an activity are
derived by summing *actual hours* in the associated DAILY WORK entity.
This is a high-fidelity data model if planning is done at the activity
level and employees submit daily worksheets. Planning can be done in
greater detail, however, if planners indicate how many hours of each day
each employee should spend on a project.

*A revised project management data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/planning%20revised.png)

Now you see that *planned hours* and *actual hours* are both attributes
of DAILY WORK. The message of this example, therefore, is not to assume
that planned and actual data have the same level of detail, but do not
be surprised if they do.

### Cardinality {.unnumbered}

Some data modeling languages are quite precise in specifying the
cardinality, or multiplicity, of a relationship. Thus, in a 1:m
relationship, you might see additional information on the diagram. For
example, the "many" end of the relationship might contain notation (such
as 0,n) to indicate zero or more instances of the entity at the "many"
end of the relationship.

*Cardinality and modality options*

+----------+----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| C ardin  | Mo dal   | Meaning                                       |
| ality    | ity      |                                               |
+:=========+:=========+:==============================================+
| 0,1      | Op tio   | There can be zero or one instance of the      |
|          | nal      | entity relative to the other entity.          |
+----------+----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 0,n      |          | There can be zero or many instances of the    |
|          |          | entity relative to the other entity.          |
+----------+----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 1,1      | Man dat  | There is exactly one instance of the entity   |
|          | ory      | relative to the other entity.                 |
+----------+----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 1,n      |          | The entity must have at least one and can     |
|          |          | have many instances relative to the other     |
|          |          | entity.                                       |
+----------+----------+-----------------------------------------------+

The data modeling method of this text, as you now realize, has taken a
broad approach to cardinality (is it 1:1 or 1:m?). We have not been
concerned with greater precision (is it 0,1 or 1,1?), because the focus
has been on acquiring basic data modeling skills. Once you know how to
model, you can add more detail. When learning to model, too much detail
and too much terminology can get in the way of mastering this difficult
skill. Also, it is far easier to sketch models on a whiteboard or paper
when you have less to draw. Once you switch to a data modeling tool,
then adding cardinality precision is easier and appropriate.

*Modality*

Modality, also known as optionality, specifies whether an instance of an
entity must participate in a relationship. Cardinality indicates the
range of instances of an entity participating in a relationship, while
modality defines the minimum number of instances. Cardinality and
modality are linked, as shown in the table above. If an entity is
optional, the minimum cardinality will be 0, and if mandatory, the
minimum cardinality is 1.

By asking the question, "Does an occurrence of this entity require an
occurrence of the other entity?" you can assess whether an entity is
mandatory. The usual practice is to use "O" for optional and place it
near the entity that is optional. Mandatory relationships are often
indicated by a short line (or bar) at right angles to the relationship
between the entities.

In the following figure, it is mandatory for an instance of STOCK to
have an instance of NATION, and optional for an instance of NATION to
have an instance of STOCK, which means we can record details of a nation
for which stocks have not yet been purchased. During conversion of the
data model to a relational database, the mandatory requirement (i.e.,
each stock must have a nation) is enforced by the foreign key
constraint.

*1:m relationship showing modality*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/nation-stock-modal.png)

Now consider an example of an m:m relationship. A SALE can have many
LINEITEMs, and a LINEITEM has only one SALE. An instance of LINEITEM
must be related to an instance of SALE, otherwise it can't exist.
Similarly, it is mandatory for an instance of SALE to have an instance
of LINEITEM, because it makes no sense to have a sale without any items
being sold.

In a relational database, the foreign key constraint handles the
mandatory relationship between instances of LINEITEM and SALE, The
mandatory requirement between SALE and LINEITEM has to be built into the
processing logic of the application that processes a sales transaction.
Basic business logic requires that a sale include some items, so a sales
transaction creates one instance of SALE and multiple instances of
LINEITEM. It does not make sense to have a sale that does not sell
something.

*An m:m relationship showing modality*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/m-and-m-modality.png)

The relationship between ITEM and LINEITEM is similar in structure to
that of NATION and STOCK, which we saw in the previous example. An
instance of a LINEITEM has a mandatory requirement for an instance of
ITEM. An instance of an ITEM can exist without the need for an instance
of a LINEITEM (i.e., the items that have not been sold).

We gain further understanding of modality by considering a 1:1
relationship. We focus attention on the 1:1 because the 1:m relationship
has been covered. The 1:1 implies that it is mandatory for an instance
of DEPT to be related to one instance of EMP (i.e., a department must
have a person who is the boss), and an instance of EMP is optionally
related to one instance of DEPT (i.e., an employee can be a boss, but
not all employees are departmental bosses).

*A 1:1 relationship showing modality*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/1-and-1-modality.png)

Earlier, when deciding where to store the foreign key for the 1:1
relationship, we settled on placing the foreign key in DEPT, because all
departments have a boss. Now we have a rule. The foreign key goes with
the entity for which the relationship is mandatory. When specifying the
create statements, you will need to be aware of the chicken-and-egg
connection between DEPT and EMP. We cannot insert an employee in EMP
unless we know that person's department, and we cannot insert a
department unless we have already inserted the boss for that department
in EMP. We can get around this problem by using a **deferrable foreign
key constraint**, but at this point we don't know enough about
transaction processing to discuss this approach.

Let's now consider recursive relationships. The following figure shows a
recursive 1:m between employees, representing that one employee can be
the boss of many other employees and a person has one boss. It is
optional that a person is a boss, and optional that everyone has a boss,
mainly because there has to be one person who is the boss of everyone.
However, we can get around this one exception by inserting employees in
a particular order. By inserting the biggest boss first, we effectively
make it mandatory that all employees have a boss. Nevertheless, data
models cover every situation and exception, so we still show the
relationship as optional.

*1:m recursive with modality*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/rec-1-and-m-modality.png)

We rely again on the British monarchy. This time we use it to illustrate
modality with a 1:1 recursive relationship. As the following figure
shows, it is optional for a monarch to have a successor. We are not
talking about the end of a monarchy, but rather how we address the data
modeling issue of not knowing who succeeds the current monarch.
Similarly, there must be a monarch who did not succeed someone (i.e.,
the first king or queen). Thus, both ends of the succession relationship
have optional modality.

*1:1 recursive with modality*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/rec-1-and-1-modality.png)

Finally, in our exploration of modality, we examine the m:m recursive.
The model indicates that it is optional for a product to have components
and optional for a product to be a component in other products. However,
every assembly must have associated products.

*m:m recursive with modality*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/rec-m-and-m-modality.png)

#### Summary {.unnumbered}

Modality adds additional information to a data model, and once you have
grasped the fundamental ideas of entities and relationships, it is quite
straightforward to consider whether a relationship is optional or
mandatory. When a relationship is mandatory, you need to consider what
constraint you can add to a table's definition to enforce the
relationship. As we have seen, in some cases the foreign key constraint
handles mandatory relationships. In other cases, the logic for enforcing
a requirement will be built into the application.

### Entity types {.unnumbered}

A data model contains different kinds of entities, which are
distinguished by the format of their identifiers. Labeling each of these
entities by type will help you to determine what questions to ask.

#### Independent entity {.unnumbered}

An independent entity is often central to a data model and foremost in
the client's mind. Independent entities are frequently the starting
points of a data model. Remember that in the investment database, the
independent entities are STOCK and NATION. Independent entities
typically have clearly distinguishable names because they occur so
frequently in the client's world. In addition, they usually have a
single identifier, such as *stock code* or *nation code*.

Independent entities are often connected to other independent entities
in a 1:m or m:m relationship. The data model in the following figure
shows two independent entities linked in a 1:m relationship.

*NATION and STOCK---independent entities*

![](Figures/Chapter%204/nation-stock.png){width="370"}

#### Weak or dependent entity {.unnumbered}

A weak entity (also known as a dependent entity) relies on another
entity for its existence and identification. It is recognized by a plus
on the weak entity's end of the relationship. CITY cannot exist without
REGION. A CITY is uniquely identified by *cityname* and *regname*. If
the composite identifier becomes unwieldy, creating an arbitrary
identifier (e.g., cityno) will change the weak entity into an
independent one.

*CITY---a weak entity*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/region-city.png){width="360"}

#### Associative entity {.unnumbered}

Associative entities are by-products of m:m relationships. They are
typically found between independent entities. Associative entities
sometimes have obvious names because they occur in the real world. For
instance, the associative entity for the m:m relationship between
DEPARTMENT and EMPLOYEE is usually called POSITION. If the associative
entity does not have a common name, the two entity names are generally
hyphenated (e.g., DEPARTMENT-EMPLOYEE). Always search for the
appropriate name, because it will improve the quality of the data model.
Hyphenated names are a last resort.

*POSITION is an associative entity*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/history-2.png)

Associative entities can show either the current or the historic
relationship between two entities. If an associative entity's only
identifiers are the two related entities' identifiers, then it records
the current relationship between the entities. If the associative entity
has some time measure (e.g., date or hour) as a partial identifier, then
it records the history of the relationship. Whenever you find an
associative entity, ask the client whether the history of the
relationship should be recorded.

Creating a single, arbitrary identifier for an associative entity will
change it to an independent one. This is likely to happen if the
associative entity becomes central to an application. For example, if a
personnel department does a lot of work with POSITION, it may find it
more expedient to give it a separate identifier (e.g., *position
number*).

#### Aggregate entity {.unnumbered}

An aggregate entity is created when several different entities have
similar attributes that are distinguished by a preceding or following
modifier to keep their names unique. For example, because components of
an address might occur in several entities (e.g., CUSTOMER and
SUPPLIER), an aggregate address entity can be created to store details
of all addresses. Aggregate entities usually become independent
entities. In this case, we could use *address number* to identify an
instance of address uniquely.

#### Subordinate entity {.unnumbered}

A subordinate entity stores data about an entity that can vary among
instances. A subordinate entity is useful when an entity consists of
mutually exclusive classes that have different descriptions. The farm
animal database shown in the following figure indicates that the farmer
requires different data for sheep and horses. Notice that each of the
subordinate entities is identified by the related entity's identifier.
You could avoid subordinate entities by placing all the attributes in
ANIMAL, but then you make it incumbent on the client to remember which
attributes apply to horses and which to sheep. This becomes an important
issue for null fields. For example, is the attribute *hay consumption*
null because it does not apply to sheep, or is it null because the value
is unknown?

*SHEEP and HORSE are subordinate entities*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/animal.png){width="360"}

If a subordinate entity becomes important, it is likely to evolve into
an independent entity. The framing of a problem often determines whether
subordinate entities are created. Stating the problem as, "a farmer has
many animals, and these animals can be horses or sheep," might lead to
the creation of subordinate entities. Alternatively, saying that "a
farmer has many sheep and horses" might lead to setting up SHEEP and
HORSE as independent entities.

### Generalization and aggregation {.unnumbered}

Generalization and aggregation are common ideas in many modeling
languages, particularly object-oriented modeling languages such as the
Unified Modeling Language (UML), which we will use in this section.

#### Generalization {.unnumbered}

A generalization is a relationship between a more general element and a
more specific element. In the following figure, the general element is
*animal*, and the specific elements are *sheep* and *horse*. A horse is
a subtype of animal. A generalization is often called an "is a"
relationship because the subtype element is a member of the
generalization.

A generalization is directly mapped to the relational model with one
table for each entity. For each of the subtype entities (i.e., SHEEP and
HORSE), the primary key is that of the supertype entity (i.e., ANIMAL).
You must also make this column a foreign key so that a subtype cannot be
inserted without the presence of the matching supertype. A
generalization is represented by a series of 1:1 relationships to weak
entities.

*A generalization hierarchy in UML*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/generalizationanimal.png){width="400"}

### Aggregation {.unnumbered}

Aggregation is a part-whole relationship between two entities. Common
phrases used to describe an aggregation are "consists of," "contains,"
and "is part of." The following figure shows an aggregation where a herd
consists of many cows. Cows can be removed or added, but it is still a
herd. An open diamond next to the whole denotes an aggregation. In data
modeling terms, there is a 1:m relationship between herd and cow.

*An aggregation in UML and data modeling*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/aggregate.png)

There are two special types of aggregation: shared and composition. With
**shared aggregation**, one entity owns another entity, but other
entities can own that entity as well. A sample shared aggregation is
displayed in the following figure, which shows that a class has many
students, and a student can be a member of many classes. Students, the
parts in this case, can be part of many classes. An open diamond next to
the whole denotes a shared aggregation, which we represent in data
modeling as an m:m relationship.

*Shared aggregation in UML and data modeling*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/sharedaggregate.png)

In a **composition aggregation,** one entity exclusively owns the other
entity. A solid diamond at the whole end of the relationship denotes
composition aggregation. The appropriate data model is a weak entity, as
shown in the following figure.

*Composition aggregation in UML and data modeling*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/compaggregate.png)

### Data modeling hints {.unnumbered}

A high-fidelity data model takes time to develop. The client must
explain the problem fully so that the database designer can understand
the client's requirements and translate them into a data model. Data
modeling is like prototyping; the database designer gradually creates a
model of the database as a result of interaction with the client. Some
issues will frequently arise in this progressive creation, and the
following hints should help you resolve many of the common problems you
will encounter.

### The rise and fall of a data model {.unnumbered}

Expect your data model to both expand and contract. Your initial data
model will expand as you extend the boundaries of the application. You
will discover some attributes will evolve into entities, and some 1:m
relationships will become m:m relationships. It will grow because you
will add entities, attributes, and relationships to allow for
exceptions. Your data model will grow because you are representing the
complexity of the real world. Do not try to constrain growth. Let the
data model be as large as is necessary. As a rough rule, expect your
final data model to grow to about two to three times the number of
entities of your initial data model.

Expect your data model to contract as you generalize structures. The
following fragment is typical of the models produced by novice data
modelers. It can be reduced by recognizing that PAINTING, SCULPTURE, and
CERAMIC are all types of art. A more general entity, ART, could be used
to represent the same data. Of course, it would need an additional
attribute to distinguish the different types of art recordings.

![](Figures/Chapter%207/art%20collection.png)

*The shrunken data model*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/art%20collection%20revised.png){width="152"}

As you discover new entities, your data model will grow. As you
generalize, your data model will shrink.

### Identifier {.unnumbered}

If there is no obvious simple identifier, invent one. The simplest is a
meaningless code (e.g., *person number* or *order number*). If you
create an identifier, you can also guarantee its uniqueness.

Don't overwork an identifier. The worst case we have seen is a
22-character product code used by a plastics company that supposedly not
only uniquely identified an item but told you its color, its
manufacturing process, and type of plastic used to make it! Color,
manufacturing process, and type of plastic are all attributes. This
product code was unwieldy. Data entry error rates were extremely high,
and very few people could remember how to decipher the code.

An identifier has to do only one thing: uniquely identify every instance
of the entity. Sometimes trying to make it do double, or even triple,
duty only creates more work for the client.

### Position and order {.unnumbered}

There is no ordering in a data model. Entities can appear anywhere. You
will usually find a central entity near the middle of the data model
only because you tend to start with prominent entities (e.g., starting
with STUDENT when modeling a student information system). What really
matters is that you identify all relevant entities.

Attributes are in no order. You find that you will tend to list them as
they are identified. For readability, it is a good idea to list some
attributes sequentially. For example, first name, other names, and last
name are usually together. This is not necessary, but it speeds up
verification of a data model's completeness.

Instances are also assumed to have no ordering. There is no first
instance, next instance, or last instance. If you must recognize a
particular order, create an attribute to record the order. For example,
if ranking of potential investment projects must be recorded, include an
attribute (*projrank*) to store this data. This does not mean the
instances will be stored in *projrank* order, but it does allow you to
use the ORDER BY clause of SQL to report the projects in rank order.

If you need to store details of a precedence relationship (i.e., there
is an ordering of instances and a need to know the successor and
predecessor of any instance), then use a 1:1 recursive relationship.

*Using an attribute to record an ordering of instances*

![](Figures/Chapter%206/recursive-1-and-1.png){width="235"}

### Attributes and consistency {.unnumbered}

Attributes must be consistent, retaining the same meaning for every
instance. An example of an inconsistent attribute would be an attribute
*stock info* that contains a stock's PE ratio or its ROI (return on
investment). Another attribute, say *stock info code*, is required to
decipher which meaning applies to any particular instance. The code
could be "1" for PE and "2" for ROI. If one attribute determines the
meaning of another, you have inconsistency. Writing SQL queries will be
extremely challenging because inconsistent data increases query
complexity. It is better to create separate attributes for PE and ROI.

### Names and addresses {.unnumbered}

An attribute is the smallest piece of data that will conceivably form
part of a query. If an attribute has segments (e.g., a person's name),
determine whether these could form part of a query. If so, then make
them separate attributes and reapply the query test. When you apply the
query test to *person name*, you will usually decide to create three
attributes: ***f**irst name*, *other names*, and *last name*.

What about titles? There are two sorts of modifier titles: preceding
titles (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Ms., and Dr.) and following titles (e.g., Jr.
and III). These should be separate attributes, especially if you have
divided *name* into separate attributes.

Addresses seem to cause more concern than names because they are more
variant. Business addresses tend to be the most complicated, and foreign
addresses add a few more twists. The data model fragment in the
following figure works in most cases.

*Handling addresses*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/address.png)

Common features of every address are city, state (province in Canada,
county in Eire), postal code (ZIP code in the United States), and
nation. Some of these can be null. For example, Singapore does not have
any units corresponding to states. In the United States, city and state
can be derived from the zip code, but this is not necessarily true for
other countries. Furthermore, even if this were true for every nation,
you would need a different derivation rule for each country, which is a
complexity you might want to avoid. If there is a lifetime guarantee
that every address in the database will be for one country, then examine
the possibility of reducing redundancy by just storing post code.

Notice that the problem of multiple address lines is represented by a
1:m relationship. An address line is a text string that appears as one
line of an address. There is often a set sequence in which these are
displayed. The attribute *address rank* records this order.

How do you address students? First names may be all right for class, but
it is not adequate enough for student records. Students typically have
multiple addresses: a home address, a school address, and maybe a summer
address. The following data model fragment shows how to handle this
situation. Any instance of ADDRESS LINE is identified by the composite
of *studentid**,** addresstype*, and *address rank*.

*Students with multiple addresses*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/address-multiple.png)

The identifier *address type* is used to distinguish among the different
types of addresses. The same data model fragment works in situations
where a business has different mailing and shipping addresses.

When data modeling, can you take a shortcut with names and addresses? It
is time consuming to write out all the components of name and address.
It creates clutter and does not add much fidelity. Our practical advice
is to do two things. *First**,*** create a policy for all names and
addresses (e.g., all names will be stored as three parts: first name,
other names, last name). *Second*, use shorthand forms of attributes for
names and addresses when they obey the policy. So from now on, we will
sometimes use name and address as attributes with the understanding that
when the database is created, the parts will become separate columns.

### Single-instance entities {.unnumbered}

Do not be afraid of creating an entity with a single instance. Consider
the data model fragment in the following figure which describes a single
fast-food chain. Because the data model describes only one firm, the
entity FIRM will have only one instance. The inclusion of this single
instance entity permits facts about the firm to be maintained.
Furthermore, it provides flexibility for expansion. If two fast-food
chains combine, the data model needs no amendment.

*FIRM---a single-instance entity*

![](Figures/Chapter%207/single%20instance%20(firm).png)

### Picking words {.unnumbered}

Words are very important. They are all we have to make ourselves
understood. Let the client choose the words, because the data model
belongs to the client and describes the client's world. If you try to
impose your words on the client, you are likely to create a
misunderstanding.

### Synonyms {.unnumbered}

Synonyms are words that have the same meaning. For example, task,
assignment, and project might all refer to the same real-world object.
One of these terms, maybe the one in most common use, needs to be
selected for naming the entity. Clients need to be told the official
name for the entity and encouraged to adopt this term for describing it.
Alternatively, create views that enable clients to use their own term.
Synonyms are not a technical problem. It is a social problem of getting
clients to agree on one word.

### Homonyms {.unnumbered}

Homonyms are words that sound the same but have different meanings.
Homonyms can create real confusion. *Sale date* is a classic example. In
business it can have several meanings. To the salespeople, it might be
the day that the customer shakes hands and says, "We have a deal." For
the lawyers, it is could be the day when the contract is signed, and for
production, it might be the day the customer takes delivery. In this
case, the solution is reasonably obvious; redefine *sale date* to be
separate terms for each area (e.g., *sales date*, *contract date*, and
*delivery date* for sales, legal, and production departments,
respectively).

Homonyms cause real confusion when clients do not realize that they are
using the same word for different entities or attributes. Hunt down
homonyms by asking lots of questions and querying a range of clients.

### Exception hunting {.unnumbered}

Go hunting for exceptions. Keep asking the client questions such as

-   Is it always like this?

-   Would there be any situations where this could be an m:m
    relationship?

-   Have there ever been any exceptions?

-   Are things likely to change in the future?

Always probe for exceptions and look for them in the examples the client
uses. Redesigning the data model to handle exceptions increases
fidelity.

### Relationship labeling {.unnumbered}

Relationship labeling clutters a data model. In most cases, labels can
be correctly inferred, so use labels only when there is a possibility of
ambiguity.

### Keeping the data model in shape {.unnumbered}

As you add to a data model, maintain fidelity. Do not add entities
without also completing details of the identifier and attributes. By
keeping the data model well formed, you avoid ambiguity, which
frequently leads to miscommunication.

### Used entities {.unnumbered}

Would you buy a used data model? Certainly, because a used data model is
more likely to have higher fidelity than a brand new one. A used data
model has been subjected to much scrutiny and revision and should be a
more accurate representation of the real world.

## Meaningful identifiers {.unnumbered}

An identifier is said to be meaningful when some attributes of the
entity can be inferred from the identifier's value (e.g., a code of B78
for an item informs a clerk that the item is black). The word
"meaningful" in everyday speech usually connotes something desirable,
but many data managers agree that meaningful identifiers or codes create
problems. While avoiding meaningful identifiers is generally accepted as
good data management practice, they are still widely used. After a short
description of some examples of meaningful identifiers, this section
discusses the pros and cons of meaningful identifiers.

The invoice number "12dec0001" is a meaningful identifier. The first
five positions indicate in which period the invoice was generated. The
last four digits of the invoice number have a meaning. The 0001
indicates it was the first invoice sent in December. In addition, e-mail
addresses, like [[mvdpas\@bizzo.nl]{.ul}](mailto:mvdpas@bizzo.nl), have
a meaning.

When coding a person's gender, some systems use the codes "m" and "f"
and others "1" and "2." The pair (m, f) is meaningful, but (1, 2) is not
and puts the onus on the user to remember the meaning. The codes "m" and
"f'" are derived from the reality that they represent. They are the
first letters of the words male and female. The "1" and "2" are not
abstracted from reality, and therefore they do not have an intuitive
meaning.

However, if you want to set an international standard suitable for many
languages, then you need to revert to numeric codes, because "m" and "f"
are not the first letters in all languages for male and female,
respectively. Thus the English version of the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) information interchange standard for the
representation of human sexes (ISO 5218) states:

*No significance is to be placed on the fact that "Male" is coded "1"
and "Female" is coded "2." This standard was developed based upon
predominant practices of the countries involved and does not convey any
meaning of importance, ranking or any other basis that could imply
discrimination.*

In determining whether an identifier is meaningful, one can look at the
way new values of that identifier are generated. If the creation takes
place on the basis of characteristics that appear in reality, the
identifier is meaningful. That is why the identifier of the invoice
"12dec0002," which is the identifier assigned to the second invoice
generated in December 2012, is meaningful. It is also why the e-mail
address [[rwatson\@terry.uga.edu]{.ul}](mailto:rwatson@terry.uga.edu) is
meaningful.

Meaningful identifiers clearly have some advantages and disadvantages,
and these are now considered.

*Advantages and disadvantages of meaningful identifiers*

+------------------------------+-----------------------+
| Advantages                   | Disadvantages         |
+==============================+=======================+
| Recognizable and             | Identifier exhaustion |
| rememberable                 |                       |
|                              | Reality changes       |
| Administrative simplicity    |                       |
|                              | Loss of               |
|                              | meaningfulness        |
+------------------------------+-----------------------+

### Advantages of meaningful identifiers {.unnumbered}

#### Recognizable and rememberable {.unnumbered}

People can often recognize and remember the significance of meaningful
identifiers. If, for example, someone receives an e-mail from
[[rwatson\@terry.uga.edu]{.ul}](mailto:rwatson@terry.uga.edu), this
person can probably deduce the sender's name and workplace. If a
manufacturer, for instance, uses the last two digits of its furniture
code to indicate the color (e.g., 08 = beech), employees can then
quickly determine the color of a packed piece of furniture. Of course,
the firm could also show the color of the furniture on the label, in
which case customers, who are most unlikely to know the coding scheme,
can quickly determine the color of the enclosed product.

#### Administrative simplicity {.unnumbered}

By using meaningful identifiers, administration can be relatively easily
decentralized. Administering e-mail addresses, for instance, can be
handled at the domain level. This way, one can avoid the process of
synchronizing with other domains whenever a new e-mail address is
created.

A second example is the EAN (European article number), the bar code on
European products. Issuing EANs can be administered per country, since
each country has a unique number in the EAN. When issuing a new number,
a country need only issue a code that is not yet in use in that country.
The method of contacting all countries to ask whether an EAN has already
been issued is time consuming and open to error. On the other hand,
creating a central database of issued EAN codes is an option. If every
issuer of EAN codes can access such a database, alignment among
countries is created and duplicates are prevented.

### Disadvantages of meaningful identifiers {.unnumbered}

#### Identifier exhaustion {.unnumbered}

Suppose a company with a six-digit item identifier decides to use the
first three digits to specify the product group (e.g., stationery)
uniquely. Within this group, the remaining three digits are used to
define the item (e.g., yellow lined pad). As a consequence, only one
thousand items can be specified per product group. This problem remains
even when some numbers in a specific product group, or even when entire
product groups, are not used.

Consider the case when product group "010" is exhausted and is
supplemented by the still unused product group code "940." What seems to
be a simple quick fix causes problems, because a particular product
group is not uniquely identified by a single identifier. Clients have to
remember there is an exception.

A real-world example of identifier exhaustion is a holding company that
identifies its subsidiaries by using a code, where the first character
is the first letter of the subsidiary's name. When the holding company
acquired its seventh subsidiary, the meaningfulness of the coding system
failed. The newly acquired subsidiary name started with the same letter
as one of the existing subsidiaries. The system had already run out of
identifiers.

When existing identifiers have to be converted because of exhaustion,
printed codes on labels, packages, shelves, and catalogs will have to be
redone. Recoding is an expensive process and should be avoided.

Exhaustion is not only a problem with meaningful identifiers. It can
happen with non-meaningful identifiers. The problem is that meaningful
identifier systems tend to exhaust sooner. To avoid identifier
exhaustion and maintain meaningful identifiers, some designers increase
identifier lengths (e.g., four digits for product group).

#### Reality changes {.unnumbered}

The second problem of meaningful identifiers is that the reality they
record changes. For example, a company changes its name. The College of
Business at the University of Georgia was renamed the Terry College of
Business. E-mail addresses changed (e.g.,
[[rwatson\@cba.uga.edu]{.ul}](mailto:rwatson@cba.uga.edu) became
[[rwatson\@terry.uga.edu]{.ul}](mailto:rwatson@terry.uga.edu)). An
identifier can remain meaningful over a long period only if the
meaningful part rarely or never changes.

Non-meaningful identifiers avoid reality changes. Consider the case of
most telephone billing systems, which use an account ID to identify a
customer rather than a telephone number. This means a customer can
change telephone numbers without causing any coding problems because
telephone number is not the unique identifier of each customer.

#### A meaningful identifier can lose its meaningfulness {.unnumbered}

Consider the problems that can occur with the identifier that records
both the color and the material of an article. Chipboard with a beech
wood veneer is coded BW. A black product, on the other hand, is coded
BL. Problems arise whenever there is an overlap between these
characteristics. What happens with a product that is finished with a
black veneer on beech wood? Should the code be BW or BL? What about a
black-painted product that is made out of beech wood? Maybe a new code,
BB for black beech wood, is required. There will always be employees and
customers who do not know the meaning of these not-so-meaningful
identifiers and attribute the wrong meaning to them.

### The solution---non-meaningful identifiers {.unnumbered}

Most people are initially inclined to try to make identifiers
meaningful. There is a sense that something is lost by using a simple
numeric to identify a product or customer. Nothing, however, is lost and
much is gained. Non-meaningful identifiers serve their sole purpose
well---to identify an entity uniquely. Attributes are used to describe
the characteristics of the entity (e.g., color, type of wood). A clear
distinction between the role of identifiers and attributes creates fewer
data management problems now and in the future.

| In most countries, every road vehicle is uniquely identified. The   |

| Standard 3779 in February 1977 and last revised in 1983. It is      |
| designed to identify motor vehicles, trailers, motorcycles, and     |

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

## The seven habits of highly effective data modelers {.unnumbered}

There is often a large gap between the performance of *average* and
*expert* data modelers. An insight into the characteristics that make
some data modelers more skillful than others should improve your data
modeling capabilities.

### Immerse {.unnumbered}

Find out what the client wants by immersing yourself in the task
environment. Spend some time following the client around and participate
in daily business. Firsthand experience of the problem will give you a
greater understanding of the client's requirements. Observe, ask
questions, reflect, and talk to a wide variety of people (e.g.,
managers, operations personnel, customers, and suppliers). The more you
learn about the problem, the better equipped you are to create a
high-fidelity data model.

### Challenge {.unnumbered}

Challenge existing assumptions; dig out the exceptions. Test the
boundaries of the data model. Try to think about the business problem
from different perspectives (e.g., how might the industry leader tackle
this problem?). Run a brainstorming session with the client to stimulate
the search for breakthrough solutions.

### Generalize {.unnumbered}

Reduce the number of entities whenever possible by using generalized
structures (remember the Art Collection model) to simplify the data
model. Simpler data models are usually easier to understand and less
costly to implement. Expert data modelers can see beyond surface
differences to discern the underlying similarities of seemingly
different entities.

### Test {.unnumbered}

Test the data model by reading it to yourself and several people
intimately familiar with the problem. Test both directions of every
relationship (e.g., a farmer has many cows and a cow belongs to only one
farmer). Build a prototype so that the client can experiment and learn
with a concrete model. Testing is very important because it costs very
little to fix a data model but a great deal to repair a system based on
an incorrect data model.

### Limit {.unnumbered}

Set reasonable limits to the time and scope of data modeling. Don't let
the data modeling phase continue forever. Discover the boundaries early
in the project and stick to these unless there are compelling reasons to
extend the project. Too many projects are allowed to expand because it
is easier to say *yes* than *no*. In the long run, however, you do the
client a disservice by promising too much and extending the life of the
project. Determine the core entities and attributes that will solve most
of the problems, and confine the data model to this core. Keep sight of
the time and budget constraints of the project.

### Integrate {.unnumbered}

Step back and reflect on how your project fits with the organization's
information architecture. Integrate with existing systems where feasible
and avoid duplication. How does your data model fit with the corporate
data model and those of other projects? Can you use part of an existing
data model? A skilled data modeler has to see both the fine-grained
detail of a project data model and the big picture of the corporate data
resource.

### Complete {.unnumbered}

Good data modelers don't leave data models ill-defined. All entities,
attributes, and relationships are carefully defined, ambiguities are
resolved, and exceptions are handled. Because the full value of a data
model is realized only when the system is complete, the data modeler
should stay involved with the project until the system is implemented.
The data modeler, who generally gets involved in the project from its
earliest days, can provide continuity through the various phases and
ensure the system solves the problem.

## Summary {.unnumbered}

Data modeling is both a technique for modeling data and its
relationships and a graphical representation of a database. It
communicates a database's design. The goal is to identify the facts that
must be stored in a database. Building a data model is a partnership
between a client, a representative of the eventual owners of the
database, and a designer. The building blocks are an entity, attribute,
identifier, and relationship. A well-formed data model, which means the
construction rules have been obeyed, clearly communicates information to
the client. A high-fidelity data model faithfully describes the world it
represents.

A data model is an evolving representation. Each change should be an
incremental improvement in quality. The quality of a data model can be
determined only by understanding the context in which it will be used. A
data model can model historical data relationships just as readily as
current ones. Cardinality specifies the precise multiplicity of a
relationship. Modality indicates whether a relationship is optional or
mandatory. The five different types of entities are independent,
dependent, associative, aggregate, and subordinate. Expect a data model
to expand and contract. A data model has no ordering. Introduce an
attribute if ordering is required. An attribute must have the same
meaning for every instance. An attribute is the smallest piece of data
that will conceivably form part of a query. Synonyms are words that have
the same meaning; homonyms are words that sound the same but have
different meanings. Identifiers should generally have no meaning. Highly
effective data modelers immerse, challenge, generalize, test, limit,
integrate, and complete.

### Data modeling {.unnumbered}

Create a data model from the following narratives, which are sometimes
intentionally incomplete. You will have to make some assumptions. Make
certain you state these alongside your data model. Define the
identifier(s) and attributes of each entity.

1.  The president of a book wholesaler has told you that she wants
    information about publishers, authors, and books.

2.  A university has many subject areas (e.g., MIS, Romance languages).
    Professors teach in only one subject area, but the same subject area
    can have many professors. Professors can teach many different
    courses in their subject area. An offering of a course (e.g., Data
    Management 457, French 101) is taught by only one professor at a
    particular time.

3.  Kids'n'Vans retails minivans for a number of manufacturers. Each
    manufacturer offers several models of its minivan (e.g., SE, LE,
    GT). Each model comes with a standard set of equipment (e.g., the
    Acme SE comes with wheels, seats, and an engine). Minivans can have
    a variety of additional equipment or accessories (radio,
    air-conditioning, automatic transmission, airbag, etc.), but not all
    accessories are available for all minivans (e.g., not all
    manufacturers offer a driver's side airbag). Some sets of
    accessories are sold as packages (e.g., the luxury package might
    include stereo, six speakers, cocktail bar, and twin overhead
    foxtails).

4.  Steve operates a cinema chain and has given you the following
    information:\
    "I have many cinemas. Each cinema can have multiple theaters. Movies
    are shown throughout the day starting at 11 a.m. and finishing at 1
    a.m. Each movie is given a two-hour time slot. We never show a movie
    in more than one theater at a time, but we do shift movies among
    theaters because seating capacity varies. I am interested in knowing
    how many people, classified by adults and children, attended each
    showing of a movie. I vary ticket prices by movie and time slot. For
    instance, Lassie Get Lost is 50 cents for everyone at 11 a.m. but is
    75 cents at 11 p.m."

5.  A university gymnastics team can have as many as 10 gymnasts. The
    team competes many times during the season. A meet can have one or
    more opponents and consists of four events: vault, uneven bars,
    beam, and floor routine. A gymnast can participate in all or some of
    these events though the team is limited to five participants in any
    event.

6.  A famous Greek shipping magnate, Stell, owns many container ships.
    Containers are collected at one port and delivered to another port.
    Customers pay a negotiated fee for the delivery of each container.
    Each ship has a sailing schedule that lists the ports the ship will
    visit over the next six months. The schedule shows the expected
    arrival and departure dates. The daily charge for use of each port
    is also recorded.

7.  A medical center employs several physicians. A physician can see
    many patients, and a patient can be seen by many physicians, though
    not always on the one visit. On any particular visit, a patient may
    be diagnosed to have one or more illnesses.

8.  A telephone company offers a 10 percent discount to any customer who
    phones another person who is also a customer of the company. To be
    eligible for the discount, the pairing of the two phone numbers must
    be registered with the telephone company. Furthermore, for billing
    purposes, the company records both phone numbers, start time, end
    time, and date of call.

9.  Global Trading (GT), Inc. is a conglomerate. It buys and sells
    businesses frequently and has difficulty keeping track of what
    strategic business units (SBUs) it owns, in what nations it
    operates, and what markets it serves. For example, the CEO was
    recently surprised to find that GT owns 25 percent of Dundee's Wild
    Adventures, headquartered in Zaire, that has subsidiaries operating
    tours of Australia, Zaire, and New York. You have been commissioned
    to design a database to keep track of GT's businesses. The CEO has
    provided you with the following information:\
    \
    SBUs are headquartered in one country, not necessarily the United
    States. Each SBU has subsidiaries or foreign agents, depending on
    local legal requirements, in a number of countries. Each subsidiary
    or foreign agent operates in only one country but can operate in
    more than one market. GT uses the standard industrial code (SIC) to
    identify a market (e.g., newspaper publishing). The SIC is a unique
    four-digit code.\
    \
    While foreign agents operate as separate legal entities, GT needs to
    know in what countries and markets they operate. On the other hand,
    subsidiaries are fully or partly owned by GT, and it is important
    for GT to know who are the other owners of any subsidiary and what
    percentage of the subsidiary they own. It is not unusual for a
    corporation to have shares in several of GT's subsidiary companies
    and for several corporations to own a portion of a subsidiary.
    Multiple ownership can also occur at the SBU level.

10. A real estate investment company owns many shopping malls. Each mall
    contains many shops. To encourage rental of its shops, the company
    gives a negotiated discount to retailers who have shops in more than
    one mall. Each shop generates an income stream that can vary from
    month to month because rental is based on a flat rental charge and a
    negotiated percentage of sales revenue. Also, each shop has monthly
    expenses for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. The company uses
    the data to compute its monthly net income per square meter for each
    shop and for ad hoc querying.

11. Draw a data model for the following table taken from a magazine that
    evaluates consumer goods. The reports follow a standard fashion of
    listing a brand and model, price, overall score, and then an
    evaluation of a series of attributes, which can vary with the
    product. For example, the sample table evaluates stereo systems. A
    table for evaluating microwave ovens would have a similar layout,
    but different features would be reported (e.g., cooking quality).

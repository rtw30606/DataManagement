### Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

Students completing this chapter will

-   understand the key concepts of data management;

-   recognize that there are many components of an organization's
    memory;

-   understand the problems with existing data management systems;

-   realize that successful data management requires an integrated
    understanding of organizational behavior and information technology.

## Introduction {.unnumbered}

Imagine what would happen to a bank that forgot who owed it money or a
digital newspaper that lost the account details of its subscribers. Both
would soon be in serious difficulty, if not out of business.
Organizations have data management systems to record the myriad of
details necessary for transacting business and making informed
decisions. Since the birth of agriculture, societies and organizations
have recorded data. The system may be as simple as carving a notch in a
stick to keep a tally, or as intricate as modern database technology. A
memory system can be as personal as a to-do list or as public as
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/).

The management of organizational data, generally known as data
management, requires skills in designing, using, and managing the memory
systems of modern organizations. It requires multiple perspectives. Data
managers need to see the organization as a social system and to
understand data management technology. The integration of these views,
the socio-technical perspective, is a prerequisite for successful data
management. Today's organizations are data-driven, and decisions are
increasingly based on insights arising from data analytics.

Individuals also need to manage data. You undoubtedly are more familiar
with individual memory management systems. They provide a convenient way
of introducing some of the key concepts of data management.

## Individual data management {.unnumbered}

As humans, we are well aware of our limited capacity to remember many
things. The brain, our internal memory, can get overloaded with too much
detail, and its memory decays with time. We store a few things
internally: our cell phone number, where we last parked our car, and
faces of people we have met recently. We use external memory to keep
track of those many things we would like to remember. External memory
comes in a variety of forms.

On our smartphones, we have calendars to remind us of meetings and
project deadlines. We have a contact app to record the addresses and
phone numbers of those we contact frequently. We use to-do lists to
remind us of the things we must do today or this week. The interesting
thing about these aides-mémoire is that each has a unique way of storing
data and supporting its rapid retrieval.

Calendars come in many shapes and forms, but they are all based on the
same organizing principle. A set amount of space is allocated for each
day of the year, and the spaces are organized in date and time order,
which supports rapid retrieval. Some calendars have added features to
speed up access. For example, electronic calendars usually have a button
to select today's data.

*A calendar*

![](Figures/Chapter%201/calendar.png)

Address books also have a standard format. They typically contain
predefined spaces for storing address details (e.g., name, company,
phone, and email). Rapid access is supported by a search engine.

*An address book*

![](Figures/Chapter%201/address%20book.png)

The structure of to-do lists tends to be fairly standard. They are often
set up in list format with a small left-hand margin. The idea is to
enter each item to be done on the right side of the screen. The left
side is used to check or mark those tasks that have been completed. The
beauty of the check method is that you can quickly scan the left side to
identify incomplete tasks.

*A to-do or reminder list*

![](Figures/Chapter%201/todo%20list%20new.png){width="320"}

Many people use some form of the individual memory systems just
described. They are typically included in the suite of standard
applications for a smart phone.

These three examples of individual memory systems illustrate some
features common to all data management systems:

-   There is a storage medium. Data are stored electronically in each
    case.

-   There is a structure for storing data. For instance, the address
    book has labeled spaces for entering pertinent data.

-   The interface is organized for rapid data entry and retrieval. A
    calendar is stored in date and time sequence so that the data space
    for any appointment for a particular day can be found quickly.

-   The selection of a data management system frequently requires a
    trade-off decision. In these examples, the trade-off is screen
    dimensions versus the amount of data that can be seen without
    scrolling. For example, you will notice the address book sample
    screen is truncated and will need to be scrolled to see full address
    details.

> now have calendars, address books, to-do lists, and many more apps
> literally in our hands. What individual data are still difficult to
> manage? What might be the characteristics of an app for these data?

There are differences between internal and external memories. Our
internal memory is small, fast, and convenient (our brain is always with
us---well, most of the time). External memory is often slower to
reference and not always as convenient. The two systems are
interconnected. We rely on our internal memory to access external
memory. Our internal memory and our brain's processing skills manage the
use of external memories. For example, we depend on our internal memory
to recall how to use our smartphone and its apps. Again, we see some
trade-offs. Ideally, we would like to store everything in our fast and
convenient internal memory, but its limited capacity means that we are
forced to use external memory for many items.

## Organizational data management {.unnumbered}

Organizations, like people, need to remember many things. If you look
around any office, you will see examples of the apparatus of
organizational memory: people, bookshelves, planning boards, and
computers. The same principles found in individual memory systems apply
to an organization's data management systems.

There is a storage medium. In the case of computers, the storage medium
varies. Small files might be stored on a USB drive and large, archival
files on a magnetic disk. The chapter *Data Structure and Storage*
discusses electronic storage media in more detail.

A table is a common structure for storing data. For example, if we want
to store details of customers, we can set up a table with each row
containing individual details of a customer and each column containing
data on a particular feature (e.g., customer code).

Storage devices are organized for rapid data entry and retrieval. Time
is the manager's enemy: too many things to be done in too little time.
Customers expect rapid responses to their questions and quick processing
of their transactions. Rapid data access is a key goal of nearly all
data management systems, but it always comes at a price. Fast access
memories cost more, so there is nearly always a trade-off between access
speed and cost.

As you will see, selecting *how* and *where* to store organizational
data frequently involves a trade-off. Data managers need to know and
understand what the compromises entail. They must know the key questions
to ask when evaluating choices.

When we move from individual to organizational memory, some other
factors come into play. To understand them, we need to review the
different types of information systems. The automation of routine
business transactions was the earliest application of information
technology to business. A transaction processing system (TPS) handles
common business tasks such as accounting, inventory, purchasing, and
sales. The realization that the data collected by these systems could be
sorted, summarized, and rearranged gave birth to the notion of a
management information system (MIS). Furthermore, it was recognized that
when internal data captured by a TPS is combined with appropriate
external data, the raw material is available for a decision support
system (DSS). Online analytical processing (OLAP), data mining (DM),
business intelligence (BI), and machine learning (ML) are techniques
analyzing data captured by business transactions and gathered from other
sources (these systems are covered in detail in the chapter on
*Organizational Intelligence*). The purpose of each of these systems is
described in the following table and their interrelationship can be
understood by examining the information systems cycle.

*Types of information systems*

|   | Type | System’s purpose |
|-------------|:------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| TPS | Transaction processing system | Collect and store data from routine transactions |
| MIS | Management information system | Convert data from a TPS into information for planning, controlling, and managing an organization |
| DSS | Decision support system | Support managerial decision making by providing models for processing and analyzing data |
| BI | Business intelligence | Gather, store, and analyze data to improve decision making |
| OLAP | Online analytical processing | Provide a multidimensional view of data |
| DM | Data mining | Use of statistical analysis and artificial intelligence techniques to identify hidden relationships in data |
| ML | Machine learning | Using software to make decisions or recommendations traditionally made by humans. |

### The information systems cycle {.unnumbered}

The various systems and technologies found in an organization are linked
in a cycle. The routine ongoing business of the organization is
processed by TPSs, the systems that handle the present. Data collected
by TPSs are stored in databases, a record of the past, the history of
the organization and its interaction with those with whom it conducts
business. These data are converted into information by analysts using a
variety of software (e.g., a DSS). These technologies are used by the
organization to prepare for the future (e.g., sales in Finland have
expanded, so we will build a new service center in Helsinki). The
business systems created to prepare for the future determine the
transactions the company will process and the data that will be
collected, and the process continues. The entire cycle is driven by
people using technology (e.g., a customer booking a hotel room via a Web
browser).

*The information systems cycle*

![](Figures/Chapter%201/IS%20cycle.png)

Decision making, or preparing for the future, is the central activity of
modern organizations. Today's organizations are busy turning out goods,
services, and decisions. Knowledge and information workers, over half of
the U.S. labor force, produce the bulk of GDP. Many of these people are
decision makers. Their success, and their organization's as well,
depends on the quality of their decisions.

Industrial society is a producer of goods, and the hallmark of success
is product quality. Japanese manufacturers convincingly demonstrated
that focusing on product quality is the key to market leadership and
profitability. The methods and the philosophy of quality gurus, such as
W. Edwards Deming, have been internationally recognized and adopted by
many providers of goods and services. We are now in the information age
as is evidenced by the key consumer products of the times, such as smart
phones, tablets, and wearables. These are all information appliances,
and they are supported by a host of information services. For example,
consider how Apple connects together its various devices and services
through cloud-based systems. For example, a person can buy an electronic
book from Apple's store to read with the iBooks app on an iPhone or
iPad.

In the information society, which is based on innovation, knowledge, and
services, the key determinant of success has shifted from product
quality to decision quality. In the turbulent environment of global
business, successful organizations are those able to quickly make
high-quality decisions about what customers will buy, how much they will
pay, and how to deliver a high-quality experience with a minimum of
fuss. Companies are very dependent on information systems to create
value for their customers.

### Desirable attributes of data {.unnumbered}

Once we realize the critical importance of data to organizations, we can
recognize some desirable attributes of data.

*Desirable attributes of data*

| Shareable     | Readily accessed by more than one person at a time |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| Transportable | Easily moved to a decision maker                   |
| Secure        | Protected from destruction and unauthorized use    |
| Accurate      | Reliable, precise records                          |
| Timely        | Current and up-to-date                             |
| Relevant      | Appropriate to the decision                        |

#### Shareable {.unnumbered}

Organizations contain many decision makers. There are many occasions
when more than one person will require access to the same data at the
same time. For example, in a large bank it would not be uncommon for two
customer representatives simultaneously to want data on the latest rate
for a three-year certificate of deposit. As data become more volatile,
shareability becomes more of a problem. Consider a restaurant. The
permanent menu is printed, today's special might be displayed on a
blackboard, and the waiter tells you what is no longer available.

#### Transportable {.unnumbered}

Data should be transportable from their storage location to the decision
maker. Technologies that transport data have a long history. Homing
pigeons were used to relay messages by the Egyptians and Persians 3,000
years ago. The telephone revolutionized business and social life because
it rapidly transmitted voice data. Computers have changed the nature of
many aspects of business because they enable the transport of text,
visuals, voice, and video.

Today, transportability is more than just getting data to a decision
maker's desk. It means getting product availability data to a
salesperson in a client's office or advising a delivery driver, en
route, of address details for an urgent parcel pickup. The general
notion is that decision makers should have access to relevant data
whenever and wherever required, although many organizations are still
some way from fully achieving this goal.

#### Secure {.unnumbered}

In an information society, organizations value data as a resource. As
you have already learned, data support day-to-day business transactions
and decision making. Because the forgetful organization will soon be out
of business, organizations are very vigilant in protecting their data.
There are a number of actions that organizations take to protect data
against loss, sabotage, and theft. A common approach is to duplicate
data and store the copy, or copies, at other locations. This technique
is popular for data stored in computer systems. Access to data is often
restricted through the use of physical barriers (e.g., a vault) or
electronic barriers (e.g., a password). Another approach, which is
popular with firms that employ knowledge workers, is a noncompete
contract. For example, some software companies legally restrain computer
programmers from working for a competitor for two years after they
leave, hoping to prevent the transfer of valuable data, in the form of
the programmer's knowledge of software, to competitors.

#### Accurate {.unnumbered}

You probably recall friends who excel in exams because of their good
memories. Similarly, organizations with an accurate memory will do
better than their less precise competitors. Organizations need to
remember many details precisely. For example, an airline needs accurate
data to predict the demand for each of its flights. The quality of
decision making will drop dramatically if managers use a data management
system riddled with errors.

Polluted data threatens a firm's profitability. One study suggests that
missing, wrong, and otherwise bad data cost U.S. firms billions of
dollars annually. The consequences of bad data include improper billing,
cost overruns, delivery delays, and product recalls. Because data
accuracy is so critical, organizations need to be watchful when
capturing data---the point at which data accuracy is most vulnerable.

#### Timely {.unnumbered}

The value of a collection of data is often determined by its age. You
can fantasize about how rich you would be if you knew tomorrow's stock
prices. Although decision makers are most interested in current data,
the required currency of data can vary with the task. Operational
managers often want real-time data. They want to tap the pulse of the
production line so that they can react quickly to machine breakdowns or
quality slippages. In contrast, strategic planners might be content with
data that are months old because they are more concerned with detecting
long-term trends.

#### Relevant {.unnumbered}

Organizations must maintain data that are relevant to transaction
processing and decision making. In processing a credit card application,
the most relevant data might be the customer's credit history, current
employment status, and income level. Hair color would be irrelevant.
When assessing the success of a new product line, a marketing manager
probably wants an aggregate report of sales by marketing region. A
voluminous report detailing every sale would be irrelevant. Data are
relevant when they pertain directly to the decision and are aggregated
appropriately.

Relevance is a key concern in designing a data management system.
Clients have to decide what should be stored because it is pertinent now
or could have future relevance. Of course, identifying data that might
be relevant in the future is difficult, and there is a tendency to
accumulate too much. Relevance is also an important consideration when
extracting and processing data from a data management system. Provided
the germane data are available, query languages can be used to aggregate
data appropriately.

In the final years of the twentieth century, organizations started to
share much of their data, both high and low volatility, via the Web.
This move increased shareability, timeliness, and availability, and it
has lowered the cost of distributing data.

In summary, a data management system for maintaining an organization's
memory supports transaction processing, remembering the past, and
decision making. Its contents must be shareable, secure, and accurate.
Ideally, the clients of a data management system must be able to get
timely and relevant data when and where required. A major challenge for
data management professionals is to create data management systems that
meet these criteria. Unfortunately, some existing systems fail in this
regard, though we can understand some of the reasons why by reviewing
the components of existing organizational memory systems.

### Components of organizational memory {.unnumbered}

An organization's memory resides on various media in a variety of ways.
It is in people's minds, standard operating procedures, roles,
organizational culture, physical storage equipment, and electronic
devices. It is scattered around the organization like pieces of a jigsaw
puzzle designed by a berserk artist. The pieces don't fit together, they
sometimes overlap, there are gaps, and there are no edge pieces to
define the boundaries. Organizations struggle to design structures and
use data management technology to link some of the pieces. To understand
the complexity of this wicked puzzle, we need to examine some of the
pieces. Data managers have a particular need to understand the different
forms of organizational memory because their activities often influence
a number of the components.

*Components of organizational memory*

![](Figures/Chapter%201/org%20memory%20components.jpg)

#### People {.unnumbered}

People are the linchpin of an organization's memory. They recall prior
decisions and business actions. They create, maintain, evolve, and use
data management systems. They are the major component of an
organization's memory because they know how to use many of the other
components. People extract data from the various elements of
organizational memory to provide as complete a picture of a situation as
possible.

Each person in an organization has a role and a position in the
hierarchy. Role and position are both devices for remembering how the
organization functions and how to process data. By labeling people
(e.g., Chief Information Officer) and placing their names on an
organizational chart, the organization creates another form of
organizational memory.

Organizational culture is the shared beliefs, values, attitudes, and
norms that influence the behavior and expectations of each person in an
organization. As a long-lived and stable memory system, culture
establishes acceptable behavior and influences decision making.

People develop skills for doing their particular job---learning what to
do, how to do it, and who can help them get things done. For example,
they might discover someone in employee benefits who can handle
personnel problems or a contact in a software company who can answer
questions promptly. This social capital, which often take years to
develop, is used to make things happen and to learn about the business
environment. Despite its high value, social capital is rarely
documented, at least not beyond an address book, and much is typically
lost when a person leaves an organization.

**Conversations** are an important method for knowledge workers to
create, modify, and share organizational memory and to build
relationships and social capital. Discussions with customers are a key
device for learning how to improve an organization's products and
services and learning about competitors. The ***conversational
company*** can detect change faster and react more rapidly. The
telephone, instant message, e-mail, coffee machine, cocktail hour, and
cafeteria are all devices for promoting conversation and creating social
networks. Some firms deliberately create structures for supporting
dialog to make the people component of organizational memory more
effective.

Standard operating procedures exist for many organizational tasks.
Processing a credit application, selecting a marketing trainee, and
preparing a departmental budget are typical procedures that are clearly
defined by many organizations. They are described on Web pages, computer
programs, and job specifications. They are the way an organization
remembers how to perform routine activities. This organizational capital
is a critical resource.

Successful people learn how to use organizational memory. They learn
what data are stored where, how to retrieve them, and how to put them
together. In promoting a new product, a salesperson might send the
prospect a package containing some brochures and an email of a product
review in a trade journal, and supply the phone number and e-mail
address of the firm's technical expert for that product. People's recall
of how to use organizational memory is the core component of
organizational memory. Academics call this **metamemory**; people in
business call it *learning the ropes*. New employees spend a great deal
of time building their metamemory so that they can use organizational
memory effectively. Without this knowledge, organizational memory has
little value.

#### Tables {.unnumbered}

A table is a common form of storing organizational data. The following
table shows a price list in tabular form. Often, the first row defines
the meaning of data in subsequent rows.

*A price list*

| Product               |  Price |
|:----------------------|-------:|
| Pocket knife          |   4.50 |
| Compass               |  10.00 |
| Geopositioning system | 100.00 |
| Map measure           |   4.95 |

A table is a general form that describes a variety of other structures
used to store data. Computer-based files are tables or can be
transformed into tables; the same is true for general ledgers,
worksheets, and spreadsheets. Accounting systems make frequent use of
tables. As you will discover in the next section, the table is the
central structure of the relational database model.

Data stored in tables typically have certain characteristics:

-   Data in one column are of the same type. For example, each cell of
    the column headed "Price" contains a number. (Of course, the
    exception is the first row of each column, which contains the title
    of the column.)

-   Data are limited by the width of the available space.

Rapid searching is one of the prime advantages of a table. For example,
if the price list is sorted by product name, you can quickly find the
price of any product.

Tables are a common form of storing organizational data because their
structure is readily understood. People learn to read and build tables
in the early years of their schooling. Also, a great deal of the data
that organizations want to remember can be stored in tabular form.

#### Documents {.unnumbered}

A **document**---of which reports, manuals, brochures, and memos are
examples---is a common medium for storing organizational data. Although
documents may be subdivided into sections, chapters, paragraphs, and
sentences, they lack the regularity and discipline of a table. Each row
of a table has the same number of columns, but each paragraph of a
document does not have the same number of sentences.

Most documents are now stored electronically. Because of the widespread
use of word processing, text files are a common means of storing
documents. Typically, such files are read sequentially like a book.
Although there is support for limited searching of the text, such as
finding the next occurrence of a specified text string, text files are
usually processed linearly.

Hypertext, the familiar linking technology of the Web, supports
nonlinear document processing. A hypertext document has built-in
linkages between sections of text that permit the reader to jump quickly
from one part to another, or to a different document. As a result,
readers can find data they require more rapidly.

Although hypertext is certainly more reader-friendly than a flat,
sequential text file, it takes time and expertise to establish the links
between the various parts of the text and to other documents. Someone
familiar with the topic has to decide what should be linked and then
establish these links. While it takes the author more time to prepare a
document this way, the payoff is the speed at which readers of the
document can find what they want. A diligent author can save a great
deal of time for many readers.

#### Multimedia {.unnumbered}

Many Web sites display multimedia objects, such as sound and video
clips. Automotive company Web sites have video clips of cars, music
outlets provide sound clips of new releases, and clothing companies have
online catalogs displaying photos of their latest products. Maintaining
a Web site, because of the many multimedia objects that some sites
contain, has become a significant data management activity for some
organizations. Consider the different types of data that a news outfit
such as the [Australian Broadcasting
Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au) has to store to provide a timely,
informative, and engaging Web site.

#### Images {.unnumbered}

Images are visual data: photographs and sketches. Image banks are
maintained for several reasons. \*First\*\*, images are widely used for
identification and security. Police departments keep fingerprints and
mug shots. *Second*, images are used as evidence. Highly valuable items
such as paintings and jewelry often are photographed for insurance
records. *Third*, images are used for advertising and promotional
campaigns, and organizations need to maintain records of material used
in these ventures. Image archiving and retrieval are essential for
online retailers. *Fourth*, some organizations specialize in selling
images and maintain extensive libraries of clip art and photographs
(e.g., [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.com)).

#### Graphics {.unnumbered}

Maps and engineering drawings are examples of electronically stored
graphics. An organization might maintain a map of sales territories and
customers. Manufacturers have extensive libraries of engineering
drawings that define the products they produce. Graphics often contain a
high level of detail. An engineering drawing will define the dimensions
of all parts and may refer to other drawings for finer detail about any
components.

A graphic differs from an image in that it contains explicitly embedded
data. Consider the difference between an engineering plan for a widget
and a photograph of the same item. An engineering plan shows dimensional
data and may describe the composition of the various components. The
embedded data are used to manufacture the widget. A photograph of a
widget does not have embedded data and contains insufficient data to
manufacture the product. An industrial spy will receive far more for an
engineering plan than for a photograph of a widget.

A **geographic information systems** (GIS) is a specialized graphical
storage system for geographic data. The underlying structure of a GIS is
a map on which data are displayed. A power company can use a GIS to
store and display data about its electricity grid and the location of
transformers. Using a pointing device such as a mouse, an engineer can
click on a transformer's location to display a window of data about the
transformer (e.g., type, capacity, installation date, and repair
history). GISs have found widespread use in governments and
organizations that have geographically dispersed resources.

#### Audio {.unnumbered}

News organizations, such as [National Public Radio](https://www.npr.org)
(NPR) in the U.S., provide audio versions of their new stories for
replay. Some firms conduct a great deal of their business by phone. In
many cases, it is important to maintain a record of the conversation
between the customer and the firm's representative. The [Royal Hong Kong
Jockey Club](https://www.hkjc.com/home/english/index.aspx), which covers
horse racing gambling in Hong Kong, records all conversations between
its operators and customers. Phone calls are stored on a highly
specialized voice recorder, which records the time of the call and other
data necessary for rapid retrieval. In the case of a customer dispute,
an operator can play back the original conversation.

#### Video {.unnumbered}

A video clip can give a potential customer additional detail that cannot
be readily conveyed by text or a still image. Consequently, some auto
companies use video and virtual reality to promote their cars. On a
visit to [Rivian's Web site](https://rivian.com), you can view video
clips of the latest models in action.

#### Models {.unnumbered}

Organizations build mathematical models to describe their business.
These models, usually placed in the broader category of DSS, are then
used to analyze existing problems and forecast future business
conditions. A mathematical model can often produce substantial benefits
to the organization. Some of these models are now so detailed, they are
a *digital twin* of a product or organization and support extensive
exploration of possible product or business scenarios.

**Machine learning** can be used to create decision making models when
an organization has a large set of data of prior decisions and their
associated factors. The system *learns* by iteratively fitting a large
number of mathematical equations to the data so that the model generated
accurately predicts prior decisions.

#### Knowledge {.unnumbered}

Organizations build systems to capture the knowledge of their
experienced decision makers and problem solvers. This expertise is
typically represented as a set of rules, semantic nets, and frames in a
knowledge base, another form of organizational memory.

#### Decisions {.unnumbered}

Decision making is the central activity of modern organizations. Very
few organizations, however, have a formal system for recording
decisions. Most keep the minutes of meetings, but these are often very
brief and record only a meeting's outcome. Because they do not record
details such as the objectives, criteria, assumptions, and alternatives
that were considered prior to making a decision, there is no formal
audit trail for decision making. As a result, most organizations rely on
humans to remember the circumstances and details of prior decisions.

#### Specialized memories {.unnumbered}

Because of the particular nature of their business, some organizations
maintain memories rarely found elsewhere. Perfume companies, for
instance, maintain a library of scents, and paint manufacturers and dye
makers catalog colors.

### Components of organizational memory {.unnumbered}

Organizations are not limited to their own memory stores. There are
firms whose business is to store data for resale to other organizations.
Such businesses have existed for many years and are growing as the
importance of data in a postindustrial society expands. U.S. lawyers can
use document management services to access the laws and court decisions
of all 50 American states and the U.S. federal government. Similar legal
data services exist in many other nations. There is a range of other
services that provide news, financial, business, scientific, and medical
data.

## Problems with data management systems {.unnumbered}

Successful management of data is a critical skill for nearly every
organization. Yet few have gained complete mastery, and there are a
variety of problems that typically afflict data management in most
firms.

*Problems with organizational data management systems*

| Problem | Examples |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Redundancy | Same data are stored in different systems |
| Lack of data control | Data are poorly managed |
| Poor interface | Data are difficult to access |
| Delays | There are frequently delays following requests for reports |
| Lack of reality | Data management systems do not reflect the complexity of the real world |
| Lack of data integration | Data are dispersed across different systems |

### Redundancy {.unnumbered}

In many cases, data management systems have grown haphazardly. As a
result, it is often the situation that the same data are stored in
several different memories. The classic example is a customer's address,
which might be stored in the sales reporting system, accounts receivable
system, and a salesperson's address book. The danger is that when the
customer changes address, the alteration is not recorded in all systems.
Data redundancy causes additional work because the same item must be
entered several times. Redundancy causes confusion when what is
supposedly the same item has different values.

### Lack of data control {.unnumbered}

Allied with the redundancy problem is poor data control. Although data
are an important organizational resource, they frequently do not receive
the same degree of management attention as other important
organizational resources, such as people and money. Organizations have a
personnel department to manage human resources and a treasury to handle
cash. The IS department looks after data captured by the computer
systems it operates, but there are many other data stores scattered
around the organization. Data are stored everywhere in the organization
(e.g., on tablets and the cloud), but there is a general lack of data
management. This lack is particularly surprising, since many pundits
claim that data are a key competitive resource.

### Poor interface {.unnumbered}

Too frequently, the potential clients of data management systems are
deterred by an unfriendly interface. The computer interface for
accessing a data store is sometimes difficult to remember for the
occasional inquirer. People become frustrated and give up because their
queries are rejected and error messages are unintelligible.

### Delays {.unnumbered}

Globalization and technology have accelerated the pace of business in
recent years. Managers must make more decisions more rapidly. They
cannot afford to wait for programmers to write special-purpose programs
to retrieve data and format reports. They expect their questions to be
answered rapidly, often within an hour and sometimes more quickly.
Managers, or their support personnel, need query languages that provide
rapid access to the data they need, in a format that they want.

### Lack of reality {.unnumbered}

Organizational data stores must reflect the reality and complexity of
the real world. Consider a typical bank customer who might have a
personal checking account, mortgage account, credit card account, and
some certificates of deposit. When a customer requests an overdraft
extension, the bank officer needs full details of the customer's
relationship with the bank to make an informed decision. If customer
data are scattered across unrelated data stores, then these data are not
easily found, and in some cases important data might be overlooked. The
request for full customer details is reasonable and realistic, and the
bank officer should expect to be able to enter a single query to obtain
it. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, because data management
systems do not always reflect reality.

In this example, the reality is that the personal checking, mortgage,
and credit card accounts, and certificates of deposit all belong to one
customer. If the bank's data management system does not record this
relationship, then it does not mimic reality. This might make it
impossible to retrieve a single customer's data with a single query.

A data management system must meet the decision making needs of
managers, who must be able to request both routine and ad hoc reports.
To do so effectively, a data management system must reflect the
complexity of the real world. If it does not store required
organizational data or record a real-world relationship between data
elements, then some managerial queries might not be answerable quickly.

### Lack of data integration {.unnumbered}

There is a general lack of data integration in most organizations. Not
only are data dispersed in different forms of organizational memory
(e.g., files and image stores). Many organizations maintain file systems
that are not interconnected. Appropriate files in the accounting system
might not be linked to the production system.

This lack of integration will be a continuing problem for most
organizations for two important reasons. ***First***, earlier computer
systems might not have been integrated because of the limitations of
available technology. Organizations created simple file systems to
support a particular function. Many of these legacy systems are still in
use. ***Second***, integration is a long-term goal. As new systems are
developed and old ones rewritten, organizations can evolve integrated
systems. It is likely too costly and disruptive to try to solve the data
integration problem in one or a few step.

Many data management problems can be solved with present technology.
Data modeling and relational database technology, topics covered in
Section 2, help overcome many of the current problems.

## A brief history of data management systems {.unnumbered}

Data management is not a new organizational concern. It is an old
problem that has become more significant, important, and critical
because of the emergence of data as a critical resource for effective
performance in the modern economy. Organizations have always needed to
manage their data so that they could remember a wide variety of facts
necessary to conduct their affairs. The recent history of computer-based
data management systems is depicted in the following figure.

**File systems** were the earliest form of data management. Limited by
the sequential nature of magnetic tape technology, it was very difficult
to integrate data from different files. The advent of magnetic disk
technology in the mid-1950s stimulated development of integrated file
systems, and the **hierarchical database management system** (DBMS)
emerged in the 1960s, followed some years later by the **network DBMS**.
The spatial database, or **geographic information system** (GIS),
appeared around 1970. Until the mid-1990s, the hierarchical DBMS, mainly
in the form of IBM's DL/I product, was the predominant technology for
managing data. It was replaced by the **relational DBMS**, a concept
first discussed by Edgar Frank Codd in an academic paper in 1970 but not
commercially available until the mid-1970s. In the late 1980s, the
notion of an **object-oriented DBMS**, primed by the ideas of
object-oriented programming, emerged as a solution to situations not
handled well by the relational DBMS. Also around this time, the idea of
modeling a database as a graph resulted in **graph database
technology**. Towards the end of the 20th century, **XML** was developed
for exchanging data between computers, and it can also be used as a data
store as you will learn in section 3. More recently, distributed files
system, such as **Hadoop** and **Blockchain**, have emerged as
alternative models for data management. Other recent data management
systems include **NoSQL databases** (Not Only SQL). While these are
beyond the scope of an introductory data management text, if you decide
to pursue a career in data management you should learn about their
advantages and the applications to which they are well-suited. For
example, graph databases are a good fit for the analysis of social
networks.

This book concentrates on the relational model, currently the most
widely used data management system. In 2022, the relational database
market generated over USD50 billion in revenue.[^2] As mentioned,
Section 2 is devotedto the development of the necessary skills for
designing and using a relational database.

## Data, information, and knowledge {.unnumbered}

Often the terms ***data*** and ***information*** are used
interchangeably, but they are distinctly different. Data are raw,
unsummarized, and unanalyzed facts. Information is data that have been
processed into a meaningful form.

A list of a supermarket's daily receipts is data, but it is not
information, because it is too detailed to be very useful for decision
making. A summary of the data that gives daily departmental totals is
information, because the store manager can use the report to monitor
store performance. The same report might be data for a regional manager,
because it is too detailed for meaningful decision making at the
regional level. Information for a regional manager might be a weekly
report of sales by department for each supermarket.

Data are always data, but one person's information can be another
person's data. Information that is meaningful to one person can be too
detailed for another. A manager's notion of information can change
quickly, however. When a problem is identified, a manager might request
finer levels of detail to diagnose the problem's cause. Thus, what was
previously data suddenly becomes information because it helps solve the
problem. There is a need for information systems that let managers
customize the processing of data so that they always get information. As
their needs change, they need to be able to adjust the detail of the
reports they receive.

Knowledge is the capacity to use information. The education and
experience that managers accumulate provide them with the expertise to
make sense of the information they receive. Knowledge means that
managers can interpret information and use it in decision making. In
addition, knowledge is the capacity to recognize what information would
be useful for making decisions. For example, a sales manager might know
that requesting a report of profitability by product line is useful when
they has to decide whether to employ a new product manager. Thus, when a
new information system is delivered, managers need to be taught what
information the system can deliver what that information means, and how
it might be used.

The relationship between data, information, and knowledge is depicted in
the following figure. A knowledgeable person requests information to
support decision making. To fulfill the request, data are converted into
information. Personal knowledge is then applied to interpret the
requested information and reach a conclusion. Of course, the cycle can
be repeated several times if more information is needed before a
decision can be made. Notice how knowledge is essential for grasping
what information to request and interpreting that information in terms
of the required decision.

## The challenge {.unnumbered}

A major challenge facing organizations is to make effective use of the
data currently stored in their diverse data management systems. This
challenge exists because these various systems are not integrated and
many potential clients not only lack the training to access the systems
but often are unaware what data exist. Before data managers can begin to
address this problem, however, they must understand how organizational
memories are used. In particular, they need to understand the
relationship between information and managerial decision making. Data
management is not a new problem. It has existed since the early days of
civilization and will be an enduring problem for organizations and
societies.

### Summary {.unnumbered}

Organizations must maintain a memory to process transactions and make
decisions. Organizational data should be shareable, transportable,
secure, and accurate, and provide timely, relevant information. The
essential components are people (the most important), text, multimedia
data, models, and knowledge. A wide variety of technologies can be used
to manage data. External memories enlarge the range of data available to
an organization. Data management systems often have some major
shortcomings: redundancy, poor data control, poor interfaces, long lead
times for query resolution, an inability to supply answers for questions
posed by managers, and poor data integration. Data are raw facts;
information is data processed into a meaningful form. Knowledge is the
capacity to use information.

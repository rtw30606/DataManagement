The application backlog, a large number of requests for new information
systems, has been a recurring problem in many organizations for decades.
The demand for new information systems and the need to maintain existing
systems have usually outstripped available information systems skills.
The application backlog, unfortunately, is not a new problem. In the
1970s, Codd laid out a plan for improving programmer productivity and
accelerating systems development by improving the management of data.
Codd's **relational model**, designed to solve many of the shortcomings
of earlier systems, is currently the most popular database model.

This section develops two key skills---data modeling and query
formation---that are required to take advantage of the relational model.
We concentrate on the design and use of relational databases. This very
abrupt change in focus is part of the plan to give you a dual
understanding of data management. Section 1 is the managerial
perspective, whereas this section covers technical skills development.
Competent data managers are able to accommodate both views and apply
whichever (or some blend of the two) is appropriate.

In Chapter 1, many forms of organizational memory were identified, and
in this section we focus on files and their components. Thus, only the
files branch of organizational memory is detailed in the following
figure.

A collection of related files is a **database**. Describing the
collection of files as related means that it has a common purpose (e.g.,
data about students). Sometimes files are also called tables, and there
are synonyms for some other terms (the alternative names are shown in
parentheses). Files contain **records** (or rows). Each record contains
the data for one instance of the data the file stores. For example, if
the file stores data about students, each record will contain data about
a single student. Records have **fields** (or columns) that store the
fine detail of each instance (e.g., student's first name, last name, and
date of birth). Fields are composed of **characters** (a, b, c,.., 1,
2, 3,..., %, \$, \#,..., A, B, etc.). A **byte**, a unit of
storage sufficient to store a single letter (in English) or digit,
consists of a string of eight contiguous **bits** or binary digits.

The data management hierarchy stimulates three database design
questions:

- What collection of files should the database contain?

- How are these files related?

- What fields should each record in the file contain?

The first objective of this section is to describe data modeling, a
technique for answering the three questions. Data modeling helps you to
understand the structure and meaning of data, which is necessary before
a database can be created. Once a database has been designed, built, and
loaded with data, the aim is to deploy it to satisfy management's
requests for information. Thus, the second objective is to teach you to
query a relational database. The learning of modeling and querying will
be intertwined, making it easier to grasp the intent of database design
and to understand why data modeling is so critical to making a database
an effective tool for managerial decision making.

Chapter 3 covers modeling a single entity and querying a single-table
database. This is the simplest database that can be created. As you will
soon discover, a **data model** is a graphical description of the
components of a database. One of these components is an entity, some
feature of the real world about which data must be stored. This section
also introduces the notions of a **data definition language** (DDL),
which is used to describe a database, and a **data manipulation
language** (DML), which is used to maintain and query a database.
Subsequent chapters in this section cover advanced data modeling
concepts and querying capabilities.

Organizations are accumulating vast volumes of data because of the ease
with which data can be captured and distributed in digital format (e.g.,
smartphone cameras and tweets). The world's data are estimated to be
doubling every 1-2 years, and large companies now routinely manage
petabytes (10^15^ bytes) of data every day. Data management is a
critical function for many organizations.

The first section of this book prepares you to see the role of data and
information in an organization. The managerial perspective on data
management concentrates on why enterprises design and maintain data
management systems, or organizational memories. Chapter 1 examines this
topic by detailing the components of organizational memory and then
discussing some of its common problems. The intention is to make you
aware of the scope of data management and its many facets. Chapter 2
discusses the relationship between information and organizational goals.
Again, a very broad outlook is adopted in order to provide a sweeping
perspective on the relationship of information to organizational success
and change.

At this point, we want to give you some ***maps*** for understanding the
territory you will explore. Since the terrain is possibly very new,
these maps initially may be hard to read, and so you may need to consult
them several times before you understand the landscape you are about to
enter.

The first map is based on the Newell-Simon model[^1-section-201] of the human
information processing system, which shows that humans receive input,
process it, and produce output. The processing is done by a processor,
which is linked to a memory that stores both data and processes. The
processor component retrieves both data and processes from memory.

To understand this model, consider a person arriving on a flight who has
agreed to meet a fellow traveler in the terminal. She receives a text
message to meet her friend at B27. The message is input to her human
information processing system. She retrieves the process for
interpreting the message (i.e., decoding that B27 means terminal B and
gate 27). The person then walks to the
terminal and gate, the output. Sometimes these processes are so well
ingrained in our memory that we never think about retrieving them. We
just do them automatically.

Human information processing systems are easily overloaded. Our memory
is limited, and our ability to process data is restricted; thus we use a
variety of external tools to extend and augment our capacities. A
contacts app is an instance of external data memory. A recipe, a
description of the process for preparing food, is an example of external
process memory. Smartphones are now the external processor of choice
that we use to augment our limited processing capacity.

The original model of human information processing can be extended to
include external memory, for storing data and processes, and external
processors, for executing processes.

This model of augmented human information processing translates directly
to an organizational setting. Organizations collect inputs from the
environment: market research, customer tweets, and competitor
actions. They process these data and produce outputs: sales campaigns,
new products, price changes, and so on. The following figure gives an
example of how an organization might process data. As a result of some
market research (input), a marketing analyst (an internal processor)
retrieves sales data (data) and does a sales forecast (process). The
analyst also requests a marketing consultant (an external processor) to
analyze (process) some demographic reports (data) before deciding to
launch a new sales campaign (output).

An organization's memory comes in a variety of forms, as you will see in
Chapter 1. This memory also can be divided into data and processes. The
data part may contain information about customers. The process portion
may store details of how to handle a customer order. Organizations use a
variety of processors to handle data, including people and computers.
Organizations also rely on external sources to extend their information
processing capacity. For example, a business may use a specialist credit
agency to check a customer's creditworthiness, or an engineering firm
may use a cloud computing service for structural analysis of a bridge.
Viewed this way, the augmented human information processing model
becomes a pattern for an organizational information processing system.

This book focuses on the data side of organizational memory. While it is
primarily concerned with data stored within the organization, there is
also coverage of data in external memory. The process side of
organizational memory is typically covered in a systems analysis and
design or a business process management course.

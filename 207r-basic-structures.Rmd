Every data model is composed of the same basic structures. This is a
major advantage because you can focus on a small part of a full data
model without being concerned about the rest of it. As a result,
translation to a relational database is very easy because you
systematically translate each basic structure. This reference describes
each of the basic structures and shows how they are mapped to a
relational database. Because the mapping is shown as a diagram and SQL
CREATE statements, you might use this section frequently when first
learning data modeling.

## One entity {.unnumbered}

### No relationships {.unnumbered}

The unrelated entity was introduced in Chapter 3. This is simply a flat
file, and the mapping is very simple. Although it is unlikely that you
will have a data model with a single entity, it is covered for
completeness.

![](Figures/Reference%201/r1-person.png){width="152"}

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE person (
	personid	INTEGER,
	attribute1	… ,
	attribute2	… ,
	…
		PRIMARY KEY(personid));
```

### A 1:1 recursive relationship {.unnumbered}

A recursive one-to-one (1:1) relationship is used to describe situations
like current marriage. In most countries, a person can legally have zero
or one current spouse. The relationship should be labeled to avoid
misunderstandings. Mapping to the relational database requires that the
identifier of the one end of the relationship becomes a foreign key. It
does not matter which one you select. Notice that when `personid` is
used as a foreign key, it must be given a different column name---in
this case `partner`---because two columns in the same table cannot have
the same name. The foreign key constraint is not defined, because this
constraint cannot refer to the table being created.

![](Figures/Reference%201/r1-person-1-1.png){width="257"}

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE person (
	personid	INTEGER,
	attribute1	… ,
	attribute2	… ,
	…
	partner		INTEGER,
		PRIMARY KEY(personid));
```

### A recursive 1:m relationship {.unnumbered}

A recursive one-to-many (1:m) relationship describes situations like
fatherhood or motherhood. The following figure maps fatherhood. A father
may have many biological children, but a child has only one biological
father. The relationship is mapped like any other 1:m relationship. The
identifier of the one end becomes a foreign key in the many end. Again,
we must rename the identifier when it becomes a foreign key in the same
table. Also, as before the foreign key constraint is not defined because it
cannot refer to the table being created.

![](Figures/Reference%201/r1-person-1-m.png){width="312"}

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE person (
	personid	INTEGER,
	Attribute1	… ,
	Attribute2	… ,
	…
	father		INTEGER,
		PRIMARY KEY(personid));
```

It is possible to have more than one 1:m recursive relationship. For
example, details of a mother-child relationship would be represented in
the same manner and result in the data model having a second 1:m
recursive relationship. The mapping to the relational model would result
in an additional column to contain a foreign key `mother`, the
`personid` of a person's mother.

### A recursive m:m relationship {.unnumbered}

A recursive many-to-many (m:m) relationship can describe a situation
such as friendship. A person can have many friends and be a friend to
many persons. As with m:m relationships between a pair of entities, we
convert this relationship to two 1:m relationships and create an
associative entity.

The resulting entity friendship has a composite primary key based on the
identifier of person, which in effect means the two components are based
on *personid*. To distinguish between them, the columns are called
`personid1` and `personid2`, so you can think of friendship as a pair of
*personids*. You will see the same pattern occurring with other m:m
recursive relationships. Notice both person identifiers are independent
foreign keys, because they are used to map the two 1:m relationships
between person and friendship.

![](Figures/Reference%201/r1-person-m-m.png){width="358"}

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE person (
	personid	INTEGER,
	Attribute1	… ,
	attribute2	… ,
	…
		PRIMARY KEY(personid));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE friendship (
	personid1	INTEGER,
	personid2	INTEGER,
	attribute3	… ,
	attribute4	… ,
	…
		PRIMARY KEY(personid1,personid2),
		CONSTRAINT fk_friendship_person1
			FOREIGN KEY(personid1) REFERENCES person(personid),
		CONSTRAINT fk_friendship_person2
			FOREIGN KEY(personid2) REFERENCES person(personid));
```

A single entity can have multiple m:m recursive relationships.
Relationships such as enmity (not enemyship) and siblinghood are m:m
recursive on person. The approach to recording these relationships is
the same as that outlined previously.

## Two entities {.unnumbered}

### No relationship {.unnumbered}

When there is no relationship between two entities, the client has
decided there is no need to record a relationship between the two
entities. When you are reading the data model with the client, be sure
that you check whether this assumption is correct both now and for the
foreseeable future. When there is no relationship between two entities,
map them each as you would a single entity with no relationships.

### A 1:1 relationship {.unnumbered}

A 1:1 relationship sometimes occurs in parallel with a 1:m relationship
between two entities. It signifies some instances of an entity that have
an additional role. For example, a department has many employees (the
1:m relationship), and a department has one boss (the 1:1). The data
model fragment shown in the following figure represents the 1:1
relationship.

![](Figures/Reference%201/r1-dept-emp.png){width="500"}

The guideline, as explained in Chapter 6, is to map the relationship to
the relational model by placing the foreign key at the mandatory
relationship side of the relationship. In this case, we place the
foreign key in `department` because each department must have an
employee who is the boss.

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE employee (
	empid		INTEGER,
	empattrib1	… ,
	empattrib2	… ,
	…
		PRIMARY KEY(empid));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE department (
	deptid		CHAR(3),
	deptattrib1	… ,
	deptattrib2	… ,
	…
	bossid 		INTEGER,
		PRIMARY KEY(deptid),
		CONSTRAINT fk_department_employee
			FOREIGN KEY(bossid) REFERENCES employee(empid));
```

### A 1:m relationship {.unnumbered}

The 1:m relationship is possibly the easiest to understand and map. The
mapping to the relational model is very simple. The primary key of the
"one" end becomes a foreign key in the "many" end.

![](Figures/Chapter%204/nation-stock.png){width="400"}

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE nation (
	natcode		CHAR(3),
	natname		VARCHAR(20),
	exchrate	DECIMAL(9,5),
		PRIMARY KEY(natcode));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE stock (
	stkcode		CHAR(3),
	stkfirm		VARCHAR(20),
	stkprice	DECIMAL(6,2),
	stkqty		DECIMAL(8),
	stkdiv		DECIMAL(5,2),
	stkpe		DECIMAL(5),
	natcode		CHAR(3),
		PRIMARY KEY(stkcode),
		CONSTRAINT fk_stock_nation
			FOREIGN KEY(natcode) REFERENCES nation(natcode));
```

### An m:m relationship {.unnumbered}

An m:m relationship is transformed into two 1:m relationships. The
mapping is then a twofold application of the 1:m rule.

![](Figures/Reference%201/r1-book-copy-borrow.png){width="600"}

The `book` and `borrower` tables must be created first because `copy`
contains foreign key constraints that refer to `book` and `borrower`.
The column `borrowerid` can be null because a book need not be borrowed;
if it's sitting on the shelf, there is no borrower.

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE book (
	callno		VARCHAR(12),
	isbn		… ,
	booktitle	… ,
	…
		PRIMARY KEY(callno));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE borrower (
	borrowerid	INTEGER,
		…
		PRIMARY KEY(borrowerid));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE copy (
	bookno		INTEGER,
	duedate		DATE,
	…
	callno		VARCHAR(12),
	borrowerid	INTEGER,
		PRIMARY KEY(bookno),
		CONSTRAINT fk_copy_book
			FOREIGN KEY(callno) REFERENCES book(callno),
		CONSTRAINT fk_copy_borrower
			FOREIGN KEY (borrowerid) REFERENCES borrower(borrowerid));
```

## Another entity's identifier as part of the identifier {.unnumbered}

Using one entity's identifier as part of another entity's identifier
tends to cause the most problems for novice data modelers. One entity's
identifier is part of another identifier when there is a plus sign on an
arc. The plus is almost always at the crow's foot end of a 1:m
relationship.

Tables are formed by applying the following rule: The
primary key of the table at the other end of the relationship becomes
both a foreign key and part of the primary key in the table at the plus
end. The application of this rule is shown for several common data model
fragments.

### A weak or dependent entity {.unnumbered}

In the following figure, *regname* is part of the identifier (signified
by the plus near the crow's foot) and a foreign key of city (because of
the 1:m between region and city).

![](Figures/Chapter%207/region-city.png){width="360"}

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE region (
	regname		VARCHAR(20),
	regtype		…,
	regpop		…,
	regarea		…,
		…
		PRIMARY KEY(regname));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE city (
	cityname	VARCHAR(20),
	citypop		… ,
	cityarea	… ,
	…
	regname		VARCHAR(20),
		PRIMARY KEY(cityname,regname),
		CONSTRAINT fk_city_region
			FOREIGN KEY(regname) REFERENCES region(regname));
```

### An associative entity {.unnumbered}

In the following figure, observe that cityname and firmname are both
part of the primary key (signified by the plus near the crow's foot) and
foreign keys (because of the two 1:m relationships) of store.

![](Figures/Reference%201/r1-city-store-firm.png){width="600"}

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE city (
	cityname	VARCHAR(20),
	…
		PRIMARY KEY(cityname));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE firm
	firmname	VARCHAR(15),
	firmstreet	… ,
	firmzip		… ,
	…
		PRIMARY KEY(firmname));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE store (
	storestreet	VARCHAR(30),
	storezip	… ,
	…
	cityname	VARCHAR(20),
	firmname	VARCHAR(15),
		PRIMARY KEY(storestreet,cityname,firmname),
		CONSTRAINT fk_store_city
			FOREIGN KEY(cityname) REFERENCES city(cityname),
		CONSTRAINT fk_store_firm
			FOREIGN KEY(firmname) REFERENCES firm(firmname));
```

### A tree structure {.unnumbered}

The interesting feature of the following figure is the primary key.
Notice that the primary key of a lower level of the tree is a composite
of its partial identifier and the primary key of the immediate higher
level. The primary key of department is a composite of deptname,
divname, and firmname. Novice modelers often forget to make this
translation.

![](Figures/Reference%201/r1-tree.png)

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE firm (
	firmname	VARCHAR(15),
	…
		PRIMARY KEY(firmname));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE division (
	divname		VARCHAR(15),
	…
	firmname	VARCHAR(15),
		PRIMARY KEY(firmname,divname),
		CONSTRAINT fk_division_firm
			FOREIGN KEY(firmname) REFERENCES firm(firmname));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE department (
	deptname	VARCHAR(15),
	…
	divname		VARCHAR(15),
	firmname	VARCHAR(15),
		PRIMARY KEY(firmname,divname,deptname),
		CONSTRAINT fk_department_division
			FOREIGN KEY (firmname,divname)
				REFERENCES division(firmname,divname));
```

```{sql, connection = db, eval = FALSE}
CREATE TABLE section (
	sectionid	VARCHAR(15),
	…
	divname		VARCHAR(15),
	firmname	VARCHAR(15),
	deptname	VARCHAR(15),
		PRIMARY KEY(firmname,divname,deptname,sectionid),
		CONSTRAINT fk_department_department
			FOREIGN KEY (firmname,divname,deptname)
				REFERENCES department(firmname,divname,deptname));
```

#### Another approach to a tree structure {.unnumbered}

A more general approach to modeling a tree structure is to recognize
that it is a series of 1:m recursive relationships. Thus, it can be
modeled as follows. This model is identical in structure to that of
recursive 1:m reviewed earlier in this chapter and converted to a table
in the same manner. Notice that we label the relationship *superunit*,
and this would be a good choice of name for the foreign key.

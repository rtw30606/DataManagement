The wiring of the world has given us ubiquitous networks and broadened
the scope of issues that data management must now embrace. In everyday
life, you might use a variety of networks (e.g., the Internet, 5G, WiFi,
and bluetooth) to gain access to information wherever you might be and
whatever time it is. As a result, data managers need to be concerned
with both the **spatial and temporal** dimensions of data. **Graph
databases** have grown in popularity because they are optimized for
analyzing networks, such as social connections and supply chains. In a
highly connected world, massive amounts of data are exchanged every
minute between computers to enable a high level of global integration in
economic and social activity. **XML** has emerged as the foundation for
data exchange across many industries. It is a core technology for global
economic development. On the social side, every day people generate
millions of messages, photos, and videos that fuel services such as
Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube.

Most organizations are interested in applying data science to
analyzing the vast volumes of data they can access to learn about social trends, customers'
opinions, and entrepreneurial opportunities. The discipline of data science combines data cleaning and transformation, statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning (ML) techniques. Organizations need extensive skills
in collecting, processing, and interpreting the myriad data flows that
intersect with their everyday business. 

**Organizational or business
intelligence** is the general term for describing an enterprise's
efforts to collect, store, process, and interpret data from internal and
external sources. It is the first stage of data-driven decision making.
Once data have been captured and stored in an organizational repository,
data science techniques can be applied.

In a world awash with data, **visualization** has become increasingly
important for enabling executives to make sense of the business
environment, to identify problems, and highlight potential new
directions. **Text mining** is a popular tool for trying to make sense
of data streams emanating from tweets and blogs. The many new sources of
data and their high growth rate have made it more difficult to support
real time analysis of the torrents of data that might contain valuable
insights for an organization's managers. Fortunately, **Hadoop
distributed file system (HDFS)** and **cluster computing** methods are a
breakthrough in storing and processing data that enable faster
processing at lower cost. **Dashboards** are widely used for presenting
key information. Furthermore, the open source statistics and graphical
package, **R**, provides a common foundation for handling text mining,
data visualization, HDFS, and cluster computing. It has become another
component of the data manager's toolkit.

The section covers the following topics.

-   Graph databases
-   XML
-   Organizational intelligence
-   Introduction to R
